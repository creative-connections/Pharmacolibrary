    info ="<html><body><p>Sodium phenylbutyrate and ursodoxicoltaurine is a fixed-dose combination therapy under investigation for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It combines sodium phenylbutyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor that may modulate protein homeostasis, with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (as ursodoxicoltaurine), a neuroprotective bile acid derivative. This combination is used as an experimental/orphan therapy and is not widely approved for general use but has received conditional or fast-track designations in certain countries for ALS.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published clinical pharmacokinetic models available as of June 2024 for the sodium phenylbutyrate and ursodoxicoltaurine fixed-dose combination; estimates provided based on individual component parameters from published sources in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
