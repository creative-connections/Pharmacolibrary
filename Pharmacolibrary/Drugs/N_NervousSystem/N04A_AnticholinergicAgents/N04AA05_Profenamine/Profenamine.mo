It was primarily used for the management of Parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. Profenamine is not widely used and is largely obsolete or discontinued in most countries today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adults, as there are no published studies reporting specific pharmacokinetics for profenamine.
