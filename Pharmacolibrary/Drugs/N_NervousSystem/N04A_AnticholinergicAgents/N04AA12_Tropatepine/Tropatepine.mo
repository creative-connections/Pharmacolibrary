Its use today is limited and it is not widely available, having been largely replaced by safer or more effective antiparkinsonian agents.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for tropatepine have not been determined in published clinical or pharmacokinetic studies. The following parameters are estimated based on values typical for similar anticholinergic drugs.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Arnoux, P, et al., &amp; Cano, JP (1986).
