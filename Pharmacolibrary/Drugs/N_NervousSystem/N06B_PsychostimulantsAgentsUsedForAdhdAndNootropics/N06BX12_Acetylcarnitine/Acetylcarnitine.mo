It has been studied for its neuroprotective properties and potential therapeutic effects in neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, peripheral neuropathy, and depression. It is used as a dietary supplement and for some clinical indications in several countries, but not broadly approved as a prescription medication for CNS disorders in all regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters from published studies in healthy adult male volunteers following intravenous administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
