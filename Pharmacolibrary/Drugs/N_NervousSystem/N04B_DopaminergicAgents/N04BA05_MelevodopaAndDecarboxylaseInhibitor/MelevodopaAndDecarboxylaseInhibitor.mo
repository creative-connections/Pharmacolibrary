It was developed to enhance the bioavailability and gastrointestinal absorption of levodopa. The combination is not widely used or approved currently and has largely been replaced by standard levodopa/carbidopa therapy.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adults based on related levodopa data and analogous prodrug properties, in the absence of directly published melevodopa pharmacokinetic data.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
