It is not widely used for systemic therapy and is generally not approved for systemic pain management in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed human pharmacokinetic studies of choline salicylate as an individual entity are available. Estimates are based on extrapolation from general salicylate (e.g., sodium salicylate or acetylsalicylic acid) PK data for healthy adults after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Ramachander, G, Williams, FD, &amp; Emele, JF (1973).
