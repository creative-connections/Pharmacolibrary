It is the primary amide of valproic acid and is metabolized in vivo to valproic acid. Its use has largely been supplanted by valproic acid and its salts, and valpromide is not widely approved or in clinical use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for healthy adult individuals, as direct published PK models for valpromide are not available. Estimates are based on its rapid conversion to valproic acid and limited primary data.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Kroetz, DL, et al., &amp; Levy, RH (1993).
