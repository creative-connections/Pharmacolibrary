Its use has largely been discontinued or replaced by other antiepileptic drugs due to its lower efficacy and safety concerns, and it is not widely approved or marketed today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adult patients following oral administration, as no primary pharmacokinetic studies with reported parameters in existing literature were found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Hooper, WD, et al., &amp; Qing, MS (1992).
