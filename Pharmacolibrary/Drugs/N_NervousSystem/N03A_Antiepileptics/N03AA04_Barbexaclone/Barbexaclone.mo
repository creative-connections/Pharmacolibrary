    info ="<html><body><p>Barbexaclone is a salt combination of phenobarbital and levopropylhexedrine, formerly used as an anticonvulsant for the treatment of epilepsy and sometimes as a sedative. It is no longer widely marketed or approved for use in most countries. The compound was purported to have efficacy similar to phenobarbital with improved tolerability.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data for barbexaclone as a combination product identified in literature or regulatory databases as of 2024. The pharmacokinetic parameters are therefore estimated based on known properties of phenobarbital, the active component.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Iven, H, &amp; Feldbusch, E (1983).
