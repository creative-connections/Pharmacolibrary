It was commonly prescribed for short-term treatment of severe insomnia and as a pre-anesthetic. Due to its high abuse potential and association with drug-facilitated crimes, it is heavily restricted or banned in many countries and is not approved in the United States.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Single oral dose pharmacokinetics in healthy adult volunteers.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Pike, A, et al., &amp; Atack, JR (2007).
