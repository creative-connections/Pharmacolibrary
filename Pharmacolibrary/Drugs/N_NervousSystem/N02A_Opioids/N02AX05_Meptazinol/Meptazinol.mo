It acts as a partial agonist at opioid receptors, primarily the Î¼-opioid receptor. It was previously used especially in obstetric analgesia (e.g., labor pain), but its use has largely declined and is not common in current clinical practice due to the availability of safer or more effective alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetics in healthy adult volunteers (mixed sex) following single oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
