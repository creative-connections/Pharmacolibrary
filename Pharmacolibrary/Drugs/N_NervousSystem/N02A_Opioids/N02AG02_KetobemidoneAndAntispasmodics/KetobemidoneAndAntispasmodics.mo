    info ="<html><body><p>Combination preparations of ketobemidone (a synthetic opioid analgesic) with antispasmodic agents (such as hyoscine) were formerly used for pain with spastic components, including renal or biliary colic. Ketobemidone acts as a mu-opioid receptor agonist with analgesic effects, while antispasmodics help reduce smooth muscle spasms. This combination is not widely used or approved today in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters are available for the combination 'ketobemidone and antispasmodics' (N02AG02) in the literature; parameters below are estimated based on data from ketobemidone alone in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
