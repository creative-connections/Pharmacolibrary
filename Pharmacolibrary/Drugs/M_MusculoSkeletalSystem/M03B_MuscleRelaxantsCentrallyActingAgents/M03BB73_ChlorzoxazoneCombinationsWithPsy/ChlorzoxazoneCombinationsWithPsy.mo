The combination with psycholeptics refers to mixtures with sedative or tranquilizing agents. While chlorzoxazone was widely used in past decades, its use has declined in some countries and it may not be first-line therapy today; availability and approval status vary by region.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies specifically reporting PK parameters for the fixed-dose combination of chlorzoxazone with psycholeptics (ATC M03BB73) have been identified. Estimates based on typical adult oral chlorzoxazone monotherapy pharmacokinetics for healthy individuals are given.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
