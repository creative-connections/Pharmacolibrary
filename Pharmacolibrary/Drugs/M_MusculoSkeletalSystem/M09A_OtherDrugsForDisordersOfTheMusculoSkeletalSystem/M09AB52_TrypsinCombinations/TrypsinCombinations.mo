Historically, it has also been used as an adjunct in the treatment of soft tissue injuries and inflammatory conditions. Its clinical use has decreased with the advent of more effective therapies, and it is not a widely approved active pharmaceutical ingredient today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for typical adult subjects, as no published human PK studies with precise parameters for trypsin, combinations (ATC M09AB52), were found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Masunaga, S, et al., &amp; Abe, M (1997).
