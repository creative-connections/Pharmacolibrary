The combination is used mainly for osteoporosis management. Currently, the combination regimen is not approved as a single fixed product but may be used sequentially in clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for the combined sequential regimen in adults.
