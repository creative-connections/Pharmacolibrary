It is approved in some countries, notably in Europe, for this use and acts by generating cytotoxic reactive oxygen species when activated by near-infrared light, leading to vascular shutdown and tumor ablation.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are based on adult male patients with localized prostate cancer receiving intravenous infusion of padeliporfin during clinical trials.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Fabre, MA, et al., &amp; Ficheux, H (2007).
