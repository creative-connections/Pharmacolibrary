Its use has been largely discontinued and it is not approved for clinical use today due to safety concerns and limited efficacy compared to other available therapies.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for carboquone in humans are not available in existing peer-reviewed publications. No direct studies reporting standard PK values in patients, healthy subjects, or special populations were found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Hisaoka, M, et al., &amp; Morioka, T (1982).
