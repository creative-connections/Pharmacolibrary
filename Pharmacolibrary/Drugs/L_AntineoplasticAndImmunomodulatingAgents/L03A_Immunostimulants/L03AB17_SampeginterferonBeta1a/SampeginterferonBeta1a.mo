Pegylation provides prolonged half-life, allowing for less frequent dosing compared to non-pegylated forms. Sampeginterferon beta-1a has been under clinical investigation for MS, but as of 2024, no product with this specific name is approved or marketed.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for a pegylated interferon beta-1a formulation, based on models and properties reported for peginterferon beta-1a in healthy volunteers and MS patients.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
