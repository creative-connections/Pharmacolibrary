    info ="<html><body><p>Empegfilgrastim is a long-acting recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used to reduce the duration of neutropenia and incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy. It is a pegylated form of filgrastim, designed to extend its biological half-life and reduce dosing frequency. As of 2024, empegfilgrastim is approved for use in some regions such as South Korea.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic data are available for empegfilgrastim. Below values are estimated based on the pharmacokinetics of similar pegylated G-CSFs (e.g., pegfilgrastim) in adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
