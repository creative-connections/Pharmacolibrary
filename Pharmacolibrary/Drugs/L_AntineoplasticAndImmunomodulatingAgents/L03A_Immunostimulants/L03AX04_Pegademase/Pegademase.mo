    info ="<html><body><p>Pegademase (PEG-ADA) is a modified form of adenosine deaminase enzyme conjugated with polyethylene glycol to increase its stability and half-life. It has been used as enzyme replacement therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase deficiency. It is an FDA-approved orphan drug but less commonly used since the advent of stem cell and gene therapies.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters in ADA-SCID adult patients based on typical literature-reported dosing and known characteristics of PEGylated proteins. No published human pharmacokinetic data found for pegademase; values are approximated/extrapolated from available enzyme replacement therapy data.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
