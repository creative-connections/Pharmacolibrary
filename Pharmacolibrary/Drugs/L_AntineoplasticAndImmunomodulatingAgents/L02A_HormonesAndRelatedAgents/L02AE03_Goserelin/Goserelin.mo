It causes a reversible suppression of gonadal steroidogenesis and is indicated mainly in the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancers such as prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in premenopausal women, as well as in some cases of endometriosis. Goserelin is approved and widely used today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Healthy male volunteers, pharmacokinetics after subcutaneous administration of goserelin (standard clinical dosing regimen).</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Cheer, SM, et al., &amp; Wagstaff, AJ (2005).
