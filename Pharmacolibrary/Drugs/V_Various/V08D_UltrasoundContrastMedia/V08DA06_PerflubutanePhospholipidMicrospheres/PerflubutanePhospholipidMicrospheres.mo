It is not absorbed systemically as an active drug but serves as a contrast medium. As of 2024, it is approved and marketed in selected countries (notably Japan as 'Sonazoid'), but not worldwide.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic data is based on healthy adult volunteers after intravenous bolus administration. The agent remains primarily in the vascular space as inert microspheres, and is rapidly cleared from the circulation.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Li, P, et al., &amp; Liu, L (2024).
