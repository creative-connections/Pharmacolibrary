    info ="<html><body><p>Iodine (131I) norcholesterol, also known as 131I-6-Î²-iodomethyl-norcholesterol or NP-59, is a radiolabeled cholesterol analog used primarily as a diagnostic agent in nuclear medicine for adrenal imaging and assessment of adrenal cortical function. It is not used as a therapeutic drug, and its clinical use is rare today, generally reserved for specialized diagnostic evaluation.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No comprehensive population pharmacokinetic studies providing explicit parameter values for 131I norcholesterol in humans were identified. Available information is limited to clinical imaging reports and radiotracer kinetics in small-scale studies. The following parameters are estimated based on general radioactive cholesterol analog behavior and clinical nuclear medicine use.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
