It is primarily used in the diagnosis of bronchial hyperreactivity (asthma) in the form of a methacholine challenge test. Methacholine is not used as a therapeutic drug; its approved use is in diagnostic procedures.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No direct human pharmacokinetic data published; estimates based on available limited animal and in vitro data. Methacholine exhibits rapid metabolism by cholinesterases and an extremely short plasma half-life. Typically administered via inhalation during bronchoprovocation challenge tests.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Short, PM, et al., &amp; Lipworth, BJ (2015).
