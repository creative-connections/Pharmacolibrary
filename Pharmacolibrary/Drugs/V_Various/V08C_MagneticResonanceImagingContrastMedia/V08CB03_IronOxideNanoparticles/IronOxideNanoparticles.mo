They are also investigated for use in drug delivery and nanomedicine applications. Some forms such as Ferumoxides (V08CB03) were previously approved but are currently discontinued in several markets due to safety concerns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adult humans following intravenous administration based on published reviews and typical physicochemical behavior of iron oxide nanoparticles, as no specific primary PK study can be identified in the literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Zhang, J, et al., &amp; Garwood, M (2017).
