It binds to mannose receptors (CD206) present on macrophages within lymph nodes, enabling detection using gamma cameras. It is approved for clinical use as a diagnostic agent.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published population or compartmental pharmacokinetic models with explicit parameter values for technetium (99mTc) tilmanocept in humans were found in the peer-reviewed literature as of June 2024. No sex, age, or disease-specific PK parameters are available. The following parameters are approximate or estimated based on drug labeling, regulatory documents, and indirect sources related to radiopharmaceutical diagnostics.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
