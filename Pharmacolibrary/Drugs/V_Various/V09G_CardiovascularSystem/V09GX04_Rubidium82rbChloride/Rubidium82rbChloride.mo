It is not used as a therapeutic drug but as a diagnostic imaging agent. The drug is still approved and used today for myocardial perfusion imaging.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published compartmental pharmacokinetic models or quantified human pharmacokinetic parameters found for intravenous 82Rb chloride in healthy adults or cardiac patients. Clinical use is as a rapidly-acting radiopharmaceutical with nearly instantaneous distribution.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
