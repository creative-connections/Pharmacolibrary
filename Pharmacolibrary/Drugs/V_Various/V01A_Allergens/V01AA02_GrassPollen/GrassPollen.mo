    </table><p>Grass pollen extract (ATC code V01AA02) is an allergen-derived immunotherapy used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis caused by grass pollen allergy. It is administered as an allergen-specific immunotherapy to modify the immune systemâ€™s response to grass pollen allergens. The drug is generally used as subcutaneous injections or sublingual tablets/drops for desensitization therapy.
