    </table><p>Ademetionine, also known as S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), is a naturally occurring compound found in the body, involved in methyl group transmethylation processes. It has been used as a nutritional supplement and as a pharmaceutical for the treatment of liver disorders, depression, and osteoarthritis. While used in some countries for these indications, it is not universally approved as a drug in all jurisdictions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetics based on published reviews and summaries, as explicit compartmental modeling data with full PK parameters for ademetionine in humans is not directly available in peer-reviewed sources.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
