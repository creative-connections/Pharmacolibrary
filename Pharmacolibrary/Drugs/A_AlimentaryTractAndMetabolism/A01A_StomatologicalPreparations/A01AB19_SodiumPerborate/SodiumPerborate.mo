In medicine, it has been used as a mild antiseptic in mouthwashes and toothpaste. Its use as a pharmaceutical agent has declined due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives, and it is not an approved drug in most regions currently.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No dedicated pharmacokinetic studies in humans are available for sodium perborate, as it was mainly used in topical oral applications and not intended for systemic absorption. Systemic uptake is considered negligible and pharmacokinetics are not clinically relevant.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Saher, O, et al., &amp; Mursi, NM (2016).
