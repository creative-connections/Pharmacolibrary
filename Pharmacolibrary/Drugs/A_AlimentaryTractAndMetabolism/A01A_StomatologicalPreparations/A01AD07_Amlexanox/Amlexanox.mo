It inhibits the release of histamine and leukotrienes from mast cells. Amlexanox has also been studied for potential use in metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes due to its effects on inflammation and metabolic pathways, but it is not widely approved for systemic use and is primarily used topically in the mouth.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No clinical pharmacokinetic publication providing systemic PK parameters was found for amlexanox in humans. The following values are rough estimates based on limited data and general pharmacokinetic properties of similar small-molecule drugs. Parameters assume oral topical buccal administration in adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Khandwala, A, et al., &amp; Alfano, MC (1997). 5% amlexanox oral paste, a new treatment for recurrent minor aphthous ulcers: II.
