The drug is widely approved and currently used for this therapeutic purpose as a supplement, often in patients requiring potassium replacement due to diuretic therapy, vomiting, or other causes of potassium loss.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult individuals, as published data specifically for potassium chloride combination formulations with ATC A12BA51 is lacking.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Sattarzadeh, M, &amp; Zlotkin, SH (1999). Iron is well absorbed by healthy adults after ingestion of double-fortified (iron and dextran-coated iodine) table salt and urinary iodine excretion is unaffected. <i>The Journal of nutrition</i> 129(1) 117â€“121.
