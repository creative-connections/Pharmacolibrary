It is also a buffering agent and an antacid. Clinical use includes oral or intravenous supplementation in patients with potassium deficiency. The drug is approved and used in clinical practice today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for a typical adult, as no direct human pharmacokinetic study of potassium hydrogencarbonate with PK parameters has been published.
