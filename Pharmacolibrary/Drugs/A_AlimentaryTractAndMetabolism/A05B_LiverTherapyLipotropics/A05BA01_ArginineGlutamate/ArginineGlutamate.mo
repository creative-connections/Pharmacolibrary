It is not widely approved or commonly in use today, although it has been investigated for supportive care in liver disorders.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are not reported in peer-reviewed literature for arginine glutamate as a combined entity. The following are estimates based on known amino acid pharmacokinetics for intravenous (IV) administration in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Kernohan, AF, et al., &amp; Reid, JL (2005).
