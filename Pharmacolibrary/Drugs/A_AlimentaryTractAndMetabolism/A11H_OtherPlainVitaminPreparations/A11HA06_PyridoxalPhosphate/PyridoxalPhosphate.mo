It is primarily used as a dietary supplement in cases of vitamin B6 deficiency and for certain rare metabolic disorders. Pyridoxal phosphate is not widely used as a drug itself but is essential in human metabolism. It is not approved as a therapeutic drug for most indications but is available as a supplement.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic (PK) studies reporting model parameters (such as clearance, volume of distribution, etc.) for pyridoxal phosphate in humans were found in the scientific literature as of June 2024.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Whyte, MP, et al., &amp; Landy, H (2012).
