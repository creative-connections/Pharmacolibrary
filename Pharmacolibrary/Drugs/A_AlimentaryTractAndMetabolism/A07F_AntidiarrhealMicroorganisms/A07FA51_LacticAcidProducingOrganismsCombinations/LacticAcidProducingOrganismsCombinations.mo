They are employed to manage conditions like antibiotic-associated diarrhea, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and some forms of colitis. They are considered safe and are widely approved and utilized globally as over-the-counter supplements or adjuncts to therapy.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific pharmacokinetic parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination are typically reported for probiotic organisms in healthy adult populations, as these are live bacterial preparations and not classical chemical drugs; their transit through the GI tract, colonization, and survival are generally characterized instead of standard PK parameters.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Pandey, R, et al., &amp; Khuller, GK (2006).
