It is commonly used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, chronic constipation, and to aid in the management of cholesterol levels. Ispaghula is approved and widely used today as a non-prescription medication in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No direct pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters have been reported in scientific publications for ispaghula (psyllium) because it is considered to be pharmacologically inert, is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, and acts locally in the gut. Therefore, typical PK parameters (such as volume of distribution, clearance, bioavailability, etc.) do not apply and are not reported.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
