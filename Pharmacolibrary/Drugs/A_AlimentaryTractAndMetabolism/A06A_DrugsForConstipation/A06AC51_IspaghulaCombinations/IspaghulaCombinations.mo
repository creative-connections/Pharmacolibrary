It can also assist in the management of irritable bowel syndrome and to improve stool consistency in cases of diarrhea. Ispaghula is approved and widely used today, particularly in over-the-counter preparations for regulating bowel function.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No publicly available peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic data have been published regarding the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of ispaghula or its combinations in humans, as these are typically bulk-forming, non-absorbable agents. The following parameters are estimated based on its physicochemical characteristics as a non-absorbed, orally administered natural polysaccharide.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Díez-Láiz, R, et al., &amp; Fernández-Martínez, N (2015).
