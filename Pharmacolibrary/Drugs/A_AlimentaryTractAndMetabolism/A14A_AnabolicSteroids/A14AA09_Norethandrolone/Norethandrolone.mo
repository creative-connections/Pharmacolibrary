It was formerly used to treat a variety of conditions including anemia and osteoporosis, but is not currently approved for use in most countries due to its side effect profile and potential for misuse.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic model with parameter values for norethandrolone in humans is available. The following are estimated values based on structural similarity to other 19-nortestosterone derivatives used orally, in a standard adult population.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Sherlock, S (1968).
