It promotes growth of muscle tissue and red blood cells. Clinical use is much more limited today due to concerns about side effects and potential for abuse; its use is currently restricted or banned in many countries and primarily approved for specific indications such as anemia associated with chronic kidney disease.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported in healthy adult male volunteers after a single 100 mg intramuscular injection of nandrolone decanoate.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Kintz, P, et al., &amp; Ludes, B (1999).
