Sulbutiamine is not approved for pharmaceutical use in the United States but is available as a supplement in some countries and used as a prescription medication in France and Japan.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for healthy adult subjects after oral administration. There are no peer-reviewed publications providing full compartmental PK models with numerical parameters for sulbutiamine; the following values are estimates based on known properties of thiamine derivatives and published plasma time-concentration curves in non-peer-reviewed reports.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Volvert, ML, et al., &amp; Bettendorff, L (2008).
