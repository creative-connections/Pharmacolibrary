It has been employed for its ability to form protective films on the intestinal mucosa, reducing irritation and fluid loss. Its use is mostly historical and it is not a common treatment in current standard care guidelines; its combinations are similarly not widely approved in modern medicine.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data available for albumin tannate or its combinations in humans.
