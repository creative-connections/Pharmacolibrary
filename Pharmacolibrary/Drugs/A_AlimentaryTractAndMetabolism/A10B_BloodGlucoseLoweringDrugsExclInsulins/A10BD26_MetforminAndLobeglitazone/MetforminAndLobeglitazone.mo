Metformin is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent that decreases hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity. Lobeglitazone is a thiazolidinedione (TZD) that acts as an insulin sensitizer by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Î³). The combination is designed to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Lobeglitazone is approved mainly in South Korea and some Asian countries; the combination product is not widely approved outside these regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>There are currently no published population pharmacokinetic models or clinical PK studies reported for the fixed-dose combination of metformin and lobeglitazone in peer-reviewed sources as of June 2024. Below are estimated pharmacokinetic parameters based on known properties of metformin and lobeglitazone administered orally in typical adult populations.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
