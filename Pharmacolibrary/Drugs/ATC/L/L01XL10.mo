It is used as a treatment for Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG)-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) in adults. Nadofaragene firadenovec was approved by the US FDA in 2022 for this indication.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic parameters are published in the literature to date for nadofaragene firadenovec. As a gene therapy administered intravesically, it is primarily localized to the bladder with negligible systemic absorption expected in treated adult patients.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
