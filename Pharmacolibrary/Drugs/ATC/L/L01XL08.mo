    info ="<html><body><p>Lisocabtagene maraleucel is a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. It is an autologous cellular immunotherapy designed to reprogram a patient's T cells to recognize and destroy CD19-positive B cells. The drug is currently approved and marketed.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling is applicable; as a gene-modified autologous T cell therapy, exposure is typically measured by expansion and persistence of CAR T cells rather than classic PK parameters such as volume of distribution or clearance. Parameters may include Cmax, Tmax, and area under the curve (AUC) for CAR T cell expansion (copies/μg DNA or cells/μL) in treated patients, but conventional PK values (e.g., in liters or L/h) are not reported.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
