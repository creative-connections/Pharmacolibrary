It was developed for the treatment of various cancers including bladder cancer, but it is not widely approved or used in modern oncology due to limited adoption and availability.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adult cancer patients following intravenous administration, based on structural similarity to doxorubicin and sparse literature data.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> There are no dedicated peer-reviewed publications with detailed pharmacokinetic models for zorubicin. All values are estimated based on limited studies, secondary sources, and analogy with doxorubicin pharmacokinetics. Dosage is reported in the literature as typically 60 mg/m2 IV.
