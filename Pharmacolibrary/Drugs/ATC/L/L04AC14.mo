It is used primarily for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Sarilumab is approved for use in several regions including the United States and Europe.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported in healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving subcutaneous sarilumab 200 mg.
