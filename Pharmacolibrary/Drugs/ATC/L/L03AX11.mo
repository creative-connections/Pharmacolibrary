It is an antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of certain advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the limbs. Tasonermin is administered via isolated limb perfusion to maximize local anti-tumoral effects and minimize systemic toxicity. Its use is rare and restricted to specific clinical scenarios, and it is not widely approved or used today outside select specialized indications.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters of tasonermin in adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma undergoing isolated limb perfusion, as reported by clinical trials and regulatory assessments.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
