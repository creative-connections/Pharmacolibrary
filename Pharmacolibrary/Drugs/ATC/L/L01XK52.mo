The combination is intended for treatment of adult patients with certain types of prostate cancer and was approved by the European Union in May 2023.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published literature with population or compartmental pharmacokinetic models for the fixed-dose combination of niraparib and abiraterone (L01XK52) is currently available as of June 2024. Parameter estimates were inferred based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of individual components and regulatory approval documentation.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
