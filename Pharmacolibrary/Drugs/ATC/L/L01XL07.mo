It is currently FDA and EMA approved.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>As a CAR T-cell therapy, idecabtagene vicleucel does not have traditional pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) associated with small molecule or typical biologic drugs. Instead, expansion and persistence of transduced CAR T-cells are measured in peripheral blood. Published sources do not provide classic PK parameters such as volume of distribution or clearance.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Singh, AP, et al., &amp; Heald, DL (2021).
