It is developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Mirikizumab has received approval for use in ulcerative colitis in some regions as of 2023.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Population-pharmacokinetic model parameters reported for adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis after intravenous administration; majority of PK data from phase II and III clinical studies.
