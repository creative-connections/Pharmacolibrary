It is used mainly in the treatment of certain viral infections such as hepatitis B and C, and some malignancies like hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), Kaposi's sarcoma and malignant melanoma. Its use has largely been replaced by recombinant forms of interferon in most countries, but it was previously an approved therapy.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers receiving intramuscular injection.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Niwakawa, M, et al., &amp; Sumiyoshi, Y (2012).
