It binds CD19 on B-cells and CD3 on T-cells, directing cytotoxic T-cells to kill malignant B-cells. Blinatumomab is approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in adults and children.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported in adults (18â€“77 years) with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with intravenous blinatumomab.
