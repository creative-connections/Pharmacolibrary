    info ="<html><body><p>Abiraterone acetate is an oral medication used in combination with prednisolone primarily for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The drug works by inhibiting CYP17A1, an enzyme involved in androgen biosynthesis, thereby reducing androgen levels that stimulate prostate cancer growth. Prednisolone is used concomitantly to counteract mineralocorticoid excess resulting from abiraterone therapy. This combination is approved and in clinical use worldwide for advanced prostate cancer.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetics reported for adult male patients (typically age 60+ years) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, receiving the approved therapeutic dose of abiraterone acetate and prednisolone by the oral route in the fed or fasted state.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Kenta Yoshida, Justin Wilkins, Julia Winkler, Janet R Wade, Naoki Kotani, Nina Wang, Rucha Sane, Pascal Chanu,Population Pharmacokinetics of Ipatasertib and Its Metabolite in Cancer Patients.,Journal of clinical pharmacology,2021<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34273118/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34273118/</a></li><li>Edwin M Posadas, Kim N Chi, Ronald de Wit, Maja J A de Jonge, Gerhardt Attard, Terence W Friedlander, Margaret K Yu, Peter Hellemans, Caly Chien, Charlene Abrams, Juhui J Jiao, Fred Saad,Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Antitumor Effect of Apalutamide with Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Phase Ib Study.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2020<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32366670/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32366670/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
