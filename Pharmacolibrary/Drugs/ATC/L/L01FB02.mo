It is used for the treatment of relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in adult patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including a purine nucleoside analog. The drug was granted FDA approval in 2018 but has since been voluntarily withdrawn from the US market by the manufacturer.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Population pharmacokinetics in adults with relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia treated with intravenous infusion.
