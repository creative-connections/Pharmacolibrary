It is administered as an intravenous injection and is activated by illumination with light of a specific wavelength, leading to cytotoxicity in tumor cells. The drug is not widely approved but has marketing authorization in some European countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from adult cancer patients after intravenous administration.
