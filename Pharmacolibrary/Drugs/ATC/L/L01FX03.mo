It acts by binding to EpCAM on tumor cells, CD3 on T-cells, and FcÎ³ receptors on accessory cells to induce tumor cell lysis. It was granted orphan drug status and previously approved in the EU but marketing authorization was withdrawn in 2017; it is not currently approved for routine clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic estimation in adult cancer patients after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration, as data from original studies is scarce and no human PK model with explicit compartmental parameters is published.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
