    info       = "<html><body><table><tr><td>ATC code:</td><td>L02AE03</td></tr><td>route:</td><td>subcutaneous</td></tr><tr><td>n-compartments</td><td>1</td></tr></table><p>Goserelin is a synthetic decapeptide analogue of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH, also known as GnRH) used as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. It causes a reversible suppression of gonadal steroidogenesis and is indicated mainly in the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancers such as prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in premenopausal women, as well as in some cases of endometriosis. Goserelin is approved and widely used today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Healthy male volunteers, pharmacokinetics after subcutaneous administration of goserelin (standard clinical dosing regimen).</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Cheer, SM, et al., &amp; Wagstaff, AJ (2005).
