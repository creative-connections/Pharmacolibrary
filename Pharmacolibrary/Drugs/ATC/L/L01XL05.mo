It is approved in the United States and several other countries for use in patients who have received at least four prior lines of therapy.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No conventional pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, volume of distribution, or compartment modeling are typically reported for ciltacabtagene autoleucel, as it is a cell-based gene therapy. Available data is limited to cellular expansion and persistence in blood of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Wu, LS, et al., &amp; Zhou, H (2022).
