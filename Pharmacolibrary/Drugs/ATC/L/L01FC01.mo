It is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Daratumumab is approved for clinical use and is widely used in current therapeutic regimens for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for adult patients (both sexes, median age ~64) with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma administered daratumumab 16 mg/kg intravenously, data from clinical trials population PK models.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-1795'>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-1795</a> PK parameters are taken from population pharmacokinetic analysis of daratumumab in multiple myeloma patients (see Lokhorst HM et al., Clin Cancer Res 2016; and FDA clinical pharmacology review documents).
