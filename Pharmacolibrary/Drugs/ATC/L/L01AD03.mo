Due to its high toxicity and risk of inducing secondary malignancies, semustine is no longer approved for clinical use in most countries and is now considered obsolete.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Model parameters estimated for adult cancer patients, values based on pharmacokinetic data from related nitrosoureas and literature review as no primary clinical PK studies were identified for semustine in humans.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Takahashi, T (1986).
