It has been used as enzyme replacement therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase deficiency. It is an FDA-approved orphan drug but less commonly used since the advent of stem cell and gene therapies.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters in ADA-SCID adult patients based on typical literature-reported dosing and known characteristics of PEGylated proteins.
