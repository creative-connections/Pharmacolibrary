It is prepared from a patientâ€™s own peripheral blood mononuclear cells and activated ex vivo with a recombinant fusion protein (PAP-GM-CSF). Sipuleucel-T is approved and used clinically in certain countries including the United States.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No classical pharmacokinetic parameters are reported for sipuleucel-T as it is a cellular therapy involving personalized, autologous immune cells and not a traditional small molecule or biologic drug. Pharmacokinetics in the conventional sense (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) are not applicable to this therapy based on published literature and regulatory documents.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
