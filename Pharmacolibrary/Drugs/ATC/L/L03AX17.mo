It is prepared from a patientâ€™s own peripheral blood mononuclear cells and activated ex vivo with a recombinant fusion protein (PAP-GM-CSF). Sipuleucel-T is approved and used clinically in certain countries including the United States.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No classical pharmacokinetic parameters are reported for sipuleucel-T as it is a cellular therapy involving personalized, autologous immune cells and not a traditional small molecule or biologic drug. Pharmacokinetics in the conventional sense (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) are not applicable to this therapy based on published literature and regulatory documents.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Andrew Ruplin, Eve Segal, Tom McFarlane,Review of drug-drug interactions in patients with prostate cancer.,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,2024<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38720547/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38720547/</a></li><li>Debraj GuhaThakurta, Nadeem A Sheikh, Li-Qun Fan, Harini Kandadi, T Craig Meagher, Simon J Hall, Philip W Kantoff, Celestia S Higano, Eric J Small, Thomas A Gardner, Kate Bailey, Tuyen Vu, Todd DeVries, James B Whitmore, Mark W Frohlich, James B Trager, Charles G Drake,Humoral Immune Response against Nontargeted Tumor Antigens after Treatment with Sipuleucel-T and Its Association with Improved Clinical Outcome.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2015<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25649018/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25649018/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
