While approved for use in some countries such as South Africa and Russia, it has not been approved in the United States or the European Union due to safety concerns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for healthy adult volunteers following intravenous infusion, due to lack of direct published human PK model references.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Soma, LR, et al., &amp; Driessen, B (2005).
