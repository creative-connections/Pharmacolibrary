    info ="<html><body><p>This preparation contains combinations of electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, typically used for intravenous infusion to correct or prevent disturbances in electrolyte and fluid balance, especially in clinical situations such as dehydration, surgery, or intensive care. ATC code B05CB10 specifically refers to solutions containing combinations of electrolytes. These combinations are still widely used and are considered standard supportive therapy in modern medicine.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters specific to electrolyte solutions (combinations) for B05CB10 could be found in the literature, as electrolytes do not follow traditional pharmacokinetic models used for most drugs. Electrolyte kinetics depend on physiological and pathophysiological processes rather than standard compartmental PK models.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No traditional PK parameters (clearance, volume of distribution, compartmental models) exist for electrolyte solutions in combination under ATC B05CB10. Electrolyte disposition is determined by physiological mechanisms and body compartment fluid shifts rather than conventional PK models. Reported values are estimates based on standard infusion regimens.</li></ol></body></html>",
