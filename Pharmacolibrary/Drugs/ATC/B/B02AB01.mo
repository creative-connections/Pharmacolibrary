While previously approved and widely used, its use has become restricted or withdrawn in many countries due to safety concerns, primarily related to increased risk of renal dysfunction and mortality.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from studies in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Grassin-Delyle, S, et al., &amp; Urien, S (2013).
