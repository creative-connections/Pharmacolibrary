It has been used mainly to treat vitamin B12 deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, and certain neuropathies. Although various forms of vitamin B12 are used clinically, cobamamide itself is less commonly used as a pharmaceutical agent and is not widely approved for clinical therapy today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adult healthy individuals, as specific clinical data for cobamamide are not available in published literature. Estimates are based on general knowledge of vitamin B12 pharmacokinetics.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Thakkar, K, &amp; Billa, G (2015). Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency-methylcobalamine?
