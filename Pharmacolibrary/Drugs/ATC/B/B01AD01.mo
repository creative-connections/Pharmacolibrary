It is indicated for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis. While previously widely used, it has largely been replaced by newer agents in many countries due to potential allergic reactions and the availability of recombinant alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic data reported in adult patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving intravenous infusion.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Battershill, PE, et al., &amp; Goa, KL (1994).
