It belongs to the class of coumarin and indandione derivatives. Clorindione is largely discontinued and is not in widespread therapeutic use today due to the emergence of safer and more effective anticoagulants.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No referenced human pharmacokinetic studies for clorindione could be identified in the published literature.
