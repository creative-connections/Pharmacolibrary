It has been used topically for wound irrigation and as a disinfectant, and formerly for the induction of abortion (second-trimester termination) in some countries. Nowadays, its use is rare and mostly limited to topical antiseptic applications; it is not widely approved or used as a systemic agent.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic (PK) studies or established PK parameters are available for ethacridine lactate in humans.
