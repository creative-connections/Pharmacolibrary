    info ="<html><body><p>Ferrous iodine (ferrosoiodide) is an iron-iodine salt historically used as a hematinic (for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia) and for iodine supplementation in conditions such as simple goiter or mixed deficiency states. It is not currently in common or approved use in modern therapeutics due to the availability of better-characterized and safer iron and iodine supplements.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models or human studies specifically report pharmacokinetic parameters for ferrous iodine as a separate compound in healthy volunteers or patients. As such, parameters are estimated based on pharmacokinetics of other commonly used ferrous salts in oral iron therapy.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No published pharmacokinetic or clinical pharmacology data exist for ferrous iodine as a distinct compound. All parameters are approximate estimates based on published values for oral ferrous salts (e.g., ferrous sulfate). The parameters should be interpreted as rough estimates only.</li></ol></body></html>",
