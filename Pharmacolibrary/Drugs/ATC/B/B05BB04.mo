    info ="<html><body><p>Electrolytes in combination with other drugs (ATC code B05BB04) are formulations used primarily for parenteral rehydration, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and support of homeostasis in various clinical settings, such as perioperative care, intensive care, or treatment of dehydration and shock. These combinations frequently contain ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and may include glucose or other adjuvants. These are widely approved and commonly used in hospital and emergency medicine.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are generally not well characterized or specified for these mixtures, because the pharmacokinetics of electrolytes depend on the individual ions and clinical status of a patient. No published studies directly reporting compartmental pharmacokinetic models or parameters for this ATC code combination have been identified in the literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No identified published pharmacokinetic studies specifically describing compartmental PK or quantitative parameters for this ATC code combination. Values provided (Vd, clearance) are rough physiological estimates based on standard extracellular fluid volumes and typical renal clearance in adults. Parameters should be considered approximate; individual electrolytes may have distinct PK that vary with clinical condition.</li></ol></body></html>",
