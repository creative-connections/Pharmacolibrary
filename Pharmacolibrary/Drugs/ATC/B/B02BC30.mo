It is used in the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency), acquired deficiency of prothrombin complex coagulation factors (e.g., during warfarin reversal), or congenital deficiencies of these factors. Several PCCs are approved and used clinically worldwide.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated typical pharmacokinetic parameters for a healthy adult male, modeled after available data for prothrombin complex concentrates, as there are currently no published compartmental population PK models for multi-factor PCCs as a whole.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
