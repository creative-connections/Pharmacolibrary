They act as colloidal solutions to maintain plasma oncotic pressure and are used where rapid expansion of plasma is required. These agents are still approved and used in some countries, though their use is decreasing due to concerns about anaphylactic reactions and kidney effects.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for adult individuals after intravenous infusion, as no direct publication with specific PK model and values was found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Fanta, S, et al., &amp; Backman, JT (2010).
