It was previously used for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adult patients on dialysis. Due to safety concerns, including cases of severe hypersensitivity reactions, peginesatide was withdrawn from the market and is not currently approved or in clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were primarily characterized in adult CKD patients undergoing dialysis. Peginesatide exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics typical of large, pegylated molecules.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Naik, H, et al., &amp; Vakilynejad, M (2013).
