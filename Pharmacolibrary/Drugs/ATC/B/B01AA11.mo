It was primarily developed and used as a rodenticide. Tioclomarol acts as a vitamin K antagonist, inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. It is not approved for human therapeutic use and is not used in clinical medicine today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models for tioclomarol in humans or animals were identified in scientific literature as of June 2024.
