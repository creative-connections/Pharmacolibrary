It acts as a synthetic inhibitor of fibrinolysis by inhibiting plasminogen activation. It has been used in some countries for the prevention and treatment of excessive bleeding in conditions such as menorrhagia, surgery, and trauma. Aminomethylbenzoic acid is not widely approved or routinely used in many Western countries today, having largely been replaced by other agents like tranexamic acid.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic profile estimated for oral administration in adults based on limited literature and structural similarity to related antifibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid).
