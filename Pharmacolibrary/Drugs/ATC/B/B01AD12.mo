    info ="<html><body><p>Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein in plasma that, when activated, exhibits anticoagulant properties by proteolytic inactivation of Factors Va and VIIIa. It is used as a replacement therapy in individuals with hereditary protein C deficiency to prevent and treat venous thrombosis and purpura fulminans. Protein C concentrates are approved and were mainly used for congenital deficiency, especially in newborns and children, but are rarely used today due to the rarity of the indication.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for human plasma-derived protein C concentrate in healthy adult volunteers and patients with hereditary protein C deficiency.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1312621'>10.1055/s-0032-1312621</a> Parameters extracted from: HÃ¤usler M, et al. 'Pharmacokinetics of a protein-C concentrate in healthy volunteers and patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency.' Thromb Haemost 1995;73(3):439-44 and further confirmed in 2012 review (https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1312621). Reported values refer to adults; PK in pediatrics shows greater interindividual variability, often lower volume of distribution and higher clearance in infants. Dose is typical for on-demand therapy; prophylactic and therapeutic regimens may vary.</li></ol></body></html>",
