It is no longer authorized or marketed in many regions (including the EU) due to concerns about serious allergic reactions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic studies on fusafungine could be identified in indexed biomedical literature. Product information indicates topical administration as a spray, with assumed minimal systemic absorption.
