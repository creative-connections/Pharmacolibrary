It is also used in the management of hyperthyroidism and as an expectorant. It remains approved for certain uses, especially in emergency nuclear situations and for specific thyroid disorders.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult individuals, oral administration, as no pharmacokinetic studies in scientific literature directly reporting these values could be found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Sattarzadeh, M, &amp; Zlotkin, SH (1999). Iron is well absorbed by healthy adults after ingestion of double-fortified (iron and dextran-coated iodine) table salt and urinary iodine excretion is unaffected. <i>The Journal of nutrition</i> 129(1) 117â€“121.
