    </table><p>Prethcamide is a respiratory stimulant, formerly used in the treatment of respiratory depression. It is a mixture of two camphor derivatives, cropropamide and crotethamide. Prethcamide historically was used as a central nervous system stimulant to improve respiratory drive, but is no longer in widespread clinical use and is considered obsolete in most modern therapeutic regimens.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No direct pharmacokinetic data or model for prethcamide (or its components) in humans appear to be available in the literature as of June 2024.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
