Its use for pulmonary disorders has largely declined due to the availability of more selective agents. It is still used in certain cardiac conditions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated mean pharmacokinetic parameters for adults (general population) based on non-compartmental and compartmental models from historical reports.
