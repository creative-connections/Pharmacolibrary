In combination products, it is used for local treatment of nasal inflammatory conditions such as rhinitis. Tixocortol is not widely used or approved in most countries today; nasal formulations are largely historical.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>There are no published studies directly reporting pharmacokinetic parameters for tixocortol in combination products administered via the nasal route in humans.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
