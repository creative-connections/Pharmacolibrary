It is administered via inhalation route and is approved for use in many countries as an asthma controller medication.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated based on typical information available for inhaled corticosteroids, as no direct population PK study with compartment modeling and full PK parameters for inhaled flunisolide in humans could be identified in the public literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No dedicated pharmacokinetic population modeling or compartmental PK studies for inhaled flunisolide in humans with published parameter values were identified as of the latest literature. The pharmacokinetic values here are estimated based on drug class information (inhaled corticosteroids), product labeling, and general pharmacological data.
