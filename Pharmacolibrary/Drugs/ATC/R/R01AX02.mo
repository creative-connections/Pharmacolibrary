It is not typically used as a drug for direct treatment but is provided as a nutritional supplement to prevent or treat vitamin A deficiency. It is not classified as an approved prescription medicine for specific diseases in most regulatory systems.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published studies reporting specific pharmacokinetic parameters for retinol administered as a drug with ATC code R01AX02 (nasal use).
