Under the ATC code R03BA06, it is utilized for inhalation therapy in respiratory disorders. Triamcinolone is approved for use in many countries, though its use may vary depending on availability and guideline recommendations.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adult patients from non-inhaled triamcinolone models extrapolated to inhaled route due to lack of published specific PK data for inhaled triamcinolone acetonide (R03BA06).</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Khadka, P, et al., &amp; Golshahi, L (2024).
