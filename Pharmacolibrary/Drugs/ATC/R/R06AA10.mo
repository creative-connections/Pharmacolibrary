It functions primarily as a dopamine (D2) receptor antagonist. Trimethobenzamide has been used in clinical practice for decades but is less commonly used today compared to other antiemetics. It is mainly approved for short-term use in the management of postoperative or toxin-induced nausea and vomiting.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adults, based on limited available literature and standard clinical dosing.
