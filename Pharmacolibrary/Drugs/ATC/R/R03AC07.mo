It is not commonly used today, having been replaced by newer, more selective beta-2 agonists.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published studies report specific pharmacokinetic parameters of isoetarine in humans. Values listed are reasoned estimates based on pharmacological analogs (e.g., isoproterenol or other beta-2 agonists) and drug class characteristics.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No direct pharmacokinetic studies have been published for isoetarine in humansâ€”parameters are estimated based on structurally and pharmacologically similar beta-2 agonists (like isoproterenol, terbutaline).
