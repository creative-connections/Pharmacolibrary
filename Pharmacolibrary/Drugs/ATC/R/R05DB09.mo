It is a cough medicine that was historically marketed in several countries but is currently not widely approved or used, in part due to limited evidence and the availability of newer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic data (such as bioavailability, clearance, volume of distribution, or compartmental modeling) are available for oxeladin in the published literature as of 2024.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Lartigue-Mattei, C, et al., &amp; Aiache, JM (1995).
