Its use has largely been discontinued in favor of newer agents due to concerns about side effects and safety profile.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated for typical adult patients; no published clinical pharmacokinetic studies or authoritative PK model parameters for isoetarine in humans were identified.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Davies, DS (1982).
