Such combinations were historically used for cough in various respiratory tract diseases, but are now largely obsolete and not approved in many modern formularies due to safety and abuse concerns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated for an adult (70kg) after a theoretical oral administration of a historical opium derivative codeine (as a representative agent) combined with a standard mucolytic such as guaifenesin, based on published PK values of codeine in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
