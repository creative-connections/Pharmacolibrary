Its use has largely been replaced by more modern agents, and it is not a widely approved or currently used medication in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No direct pharmacokinetic studies have been published for the combination of proxyphylline and adrenergics in humans. Parameters are estimated based on the known PK of proxyphylline as a single agent in adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Tarrus, E, et al., &amp; Segura, J (1981).
