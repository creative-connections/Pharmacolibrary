It acts as an H1 receptor antagonist and may exert sedative effects. Its use has declined in favor of newer, less sedating antihistamines, but it may still be available in some regions or as a component of combination anti-allergic preparations.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies found for chloropyramine in combinations (ATC R06AC53) in healthy adults or other groups.
