    info ="<html><body><p>Nitric oxide is an inhaled gas approved for the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure in neonates and infants with pulmonary hypertension. It acts as a selective pulmonary vasodilator, improving oxygenation and decreasing the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Due to its short half-life and rapid inactivation by hemoglobin, it acts locally in the pulmonary vasculature. Nitric oxide is not used orally or intravenously, and its clinical administration is limited to controlled inhalation.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are primarily determined in neonates and young children with pulmonary hypertension receiving inhaled nitric oxide; data derived from clinical use and PK estimates.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Austin Horton, Isaac T Schiefer,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nitric oxide mimetic agents.,Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,2019<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30641123/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30641123/</a></li><li>Matthias Hermann, Andreas Flammer, Thomas F LÃ¼scher,Nitric oxide in hypertension.,Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.),2006<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17170603/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17170603/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
