It exhibits anticholinergic and sedative properties. Methdilazine was widely used in the past but is not commonly prescribed today due to the availability of newer antihistamines with improved safety profiles.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models or human PK studies for methdilazine were found.
