It is active against bacteria, fungi, and some viruses. It is not indicated for systemic use and is not approved for oral or parenteral administration.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic (PK) human studies are available. Chloroxylenol is intended for topical administration, and systemic absorption is generally negligible. Pharmacokinetic parameters reported here are estimated based on physicochemical properties and general absorption data for similar topical agents.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
