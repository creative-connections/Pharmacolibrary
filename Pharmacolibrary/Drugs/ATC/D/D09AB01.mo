It is approved for medical use as a physical barrier and promotes wound healing via the anti-inflammatory and protective properties of zinc oxide. It is not intended for systemic drug delivery.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for systemic absorption of zinc from zinc bandage (Unna's boot) in adults have not been characterized in peer-reviewed literature. Absorption through intact or mildly broken skin is considered negligible and does not yield quantifiable systemic pharmacokinetic values.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Pirouzzadeh, M, et al., &amp; Vatanara, A (2025).
