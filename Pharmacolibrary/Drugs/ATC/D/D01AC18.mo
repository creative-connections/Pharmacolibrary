It inhibits fungal lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase resulting in disrupted cell membrane synthesis. As of 2024 it is approved for topical use in several countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published detailed human pharmacokinetic models available for luliconazole after topical administration; available data indicates minimal systemic absorption in healthy adults after repeated topical application.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No published sources with systemic pharmacokinetic parameters for luliconazole after topical use could be found as per latest literature (June 2024). Available product labels and review articles indicate negligible systemic absorption (<1% of dose).
