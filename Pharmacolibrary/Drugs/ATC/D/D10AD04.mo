It is an oral medication approved and in use today under strict monitoring programs due to its teratogenicity and other risks.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers (mostly male, age 18-35) following a single oral dose during fasting conditions.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/clpt.1982.164'>10.1038/clpt.1982.164</a> Parameters extracted from: Peck GL et al. 'Pharmacokinetics of oral isotretinoin.' Clin Pharmacol Ther. 1982; 31(3):331-338. Typical dose used for acne ranges from 0.5â€“1 mg/kg/day, often divided. Bioavailability increases when administered with food, especially high-fat meals.
