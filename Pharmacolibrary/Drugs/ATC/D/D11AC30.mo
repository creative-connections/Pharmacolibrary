    info ="<html><body><p>D11AC30 is an ATC code for 'others' within the class of 'Other dermatologicals - other preparations for treatment of wounds and ulcers.' It is not attributable to a specific chemical entity or widely recognized therapeutic agent. Drugs under this catch-all classification are typically used topically for dermatological use, for wound healing, or for similar purposes; often, these are agents not falling under more specific ATC subgroups. It is not recognized as a single approved drug but is a placeholder for miscellaneous preparations.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters are reported for 'others' under this ATC code, as it is a group placeholder and not a specific substance; PK data cannot be referenced from the literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Guohua An,Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of GalNAc-Conjugated siRNAs.,Journal of clinical pharmacology,2024<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37589246/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37589246/</a></li><li>Shawn M Arent, Harry P Cintineo, Bridget A McFadden, Alexa J Chandler, Michelle A Arent,Nutrient Timing: A Garage Door of Opportunity?,Nutrients,2020<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32629950/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32629950/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
