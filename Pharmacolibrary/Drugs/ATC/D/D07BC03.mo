The specific ATC code D07BC03 designates topical corticosteroid combinations with antiseptics. Not all formulations are widely available or approved in every country today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data specific to the combination of fluocortolone and antiseptics (ATC: D07BC03) was found. Existing data is based on estimates derived from generalized fluocortolone topical use in adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
