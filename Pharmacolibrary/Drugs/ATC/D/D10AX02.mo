It is included in combination acne medications and has been used for other skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. Resorcinol is not used systemically and its topical use is less common today due to the development of newer medications; products containing resorcinol remain available over-the-counter in some formulations.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for systemic absorption in adult humans after dermal application, as direct PK studies in humans are not available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>,Resorcinol.,IARC monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans,1999<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10476380/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10476380/</a></li><li>P C Merker, D Yeung, D Doughty, S Nacht,Pharmacokinetics of resorcinol in the rat.,Research communications in chemical pathology and pharmacology,1982<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7163635/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7163635/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
