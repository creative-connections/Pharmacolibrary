    info ="<html><body><p>Benzalkonium is a quaternary ammonium compound often used as a topical antiseptic and disinfectant. It is primarily utilized for skin and mucous membrane disinfection, as well as a preservative in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. Benzalkonium compounds are not systemically used as pharmaceuticals because of their local toxicity and strong irritating effects. The drug does not have approval for systemic administration.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data for systemic absorption of benzalkonium in humans exists, as the compound is intended strictly for topical and local use and is not administered systemically.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Carol A Rasmussen, Paul L Kaufman, Julie A Kiland,Benzalkonium chloride and glaucoma.,Journal of ocular pharmacology and therapeutics : the official journal of the Association for Ocular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,2014<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24205938/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24205938/</a></li><li>Arindam Halder, Ajay J Khopade,Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacology of Latanoprost 0.005% without Benzalkonium Chloride Vs Latanoprost 0.005% with Benzalkonium Chloride in New Zealand White Rabbits and Beagles.,Current eye research,2021<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33719796/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33719796/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
