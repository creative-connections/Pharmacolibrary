It is mainly used topically in ophthalmology and otolaryngology to numb the surface of the eye or ear for diagnostic or minor surgical procedures. It is still approved and used in many countries as an ophthalmic anesthetic.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic model or parameters for oxybuprocaine in humans were found; the following are estimated values based on chemical similarity to other topical ester local anesthetics and usage patterns.
