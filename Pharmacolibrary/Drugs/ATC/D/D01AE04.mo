    info       = "<html><body><table><tr><td>Drug:</td><td>D01AE04</td></tr><td>route:</td><td>topical</td></tr><tr><td>n-compartments</td><td>1</td></tr></table><p>Undecylenic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid derived from castor oil, primarily used as a topical antifungal agent for skin infections such as tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) and tinea corporis (ringworm). It is not a systemically approved drug and is mainly administered in cream, powder, or solution form for dermatological use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No human pharmacokinetic studies are available for undecylenic acid. Systemic exposure is presumed negligible when applied topically to intact skin in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Diehl, KB (1996).
