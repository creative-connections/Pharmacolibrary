It is not available in all countries and often approved for short-term use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic studies directly evaluating flumetasone and antibiotics in this fixed combination formulation by topical route. Pharmacokinetic parameters below are estimated based on general corticosteroid and topical antibiotic absorption. Absorption is considered minimal with intact skin, but increases with damaged skin or occlusion. No systemic PK data available for the combination.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
