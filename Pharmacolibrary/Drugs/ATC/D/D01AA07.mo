It is derived from Pseudomonas species and exhibits broad-spectrum activity against a variety of fungi. Pyrrolnitrin is not widely approved as a systemic pharmacological agent in humans and is mainly of historical or agricultural interest today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data for pyrrolnitrin in humans were identified. The following parameters are unreported and therefore remain unfilled.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Chang, CJ, et al., &amp; Shieh, TL (1981).
