    info ="<html><body><p>Silver is a chemical element that has been used historically in medicine for its antimicrobial properties. Systemic use is largely obsolete due to concerns of toxicity. Today, silver is primarily used topically in the form of silver sulfadiazine or silver nitrate for burns and wound dressings. Silver and its compounds are not approved for systemic use in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed publication has been found that reports quantitative pharmacokinetic models or parameters for elemental silver (ATC code D08AL30) in humans. Most use cases are topical, and systemic absorption is negligible or highly variable and not formally characterized.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Lin, YS, et al., &amp; Milgrom, P (2019).
