It has also been investigated for use in obesity and hypercholesterolemia. It is not currently approved for use by major regulatory agencies such as the FDA or EMA.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic data or models available for tiratricol. The following is an estimated single-compartment model for an adult receiving oral administration. Parameters are estimated from available secondary sources and known characteristics of thyroid hormone analogs.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Menegay, C, et al., &amp; Burger, AG (1989).
