    info ="<html><body><p>Oxymetazoline is an imidazoline derivative acting as a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist and partial alpha-2 agonist, used primarily as a topical decongestant for nasal congestion and, more recently, in topical creams for rosacea and eye drops for redness. It is approved for current clinical use as a nasal spray, ophthalmic solution, and topical dermatological preparation.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for a typical adult after topical (cutaneous) administration; no specific published human PK data found for this cutaneous route. Values are estimated from related nasal/ophthalmic human data and animal data, extrapolated for cutaneous application.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No published PK parameters for oxymetazoline by cutaneous route or in humans for systemic absorption after dermatological use. Parameters above are estimated based on selected available animal PK data and structurally/significantly similar adrenergic agents; bioavailability is presumed very low. Nasal bioavailability reported as ~1â€“2%, ophthalmic ~35%; value above is an estimate for topical skin application. Dose is a representative value for single-unit use, not a strict clinical dose.</li></ol></body></html>",
