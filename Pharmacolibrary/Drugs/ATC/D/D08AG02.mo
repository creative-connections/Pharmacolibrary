    info ="<html><body><p>Povidone-iodine is a broad-spectrum antiseptic used for skin disinfection before and after surgery, for wound cleaning, and occasionally for mucosal application. It is widely used topically and is available in many formulations. It is not intended for systemic use and is not absorbed in significant amounts when applied to intact skin. Povidone-iodine is an approved and standard antiseptic in current clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models or systemic absorption data are available for povidone-iodine when used according to approved topical administration in healthy adults. Systemic absorption is minimal except in cases of large-area application or application to damaged skin.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Jagger Koerner, Andrzej Grzybowski,Povidone-iodine pharmacokinetics and study design.,BMC ophthalmology,2020<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31952486/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31952486/</a></li><li>K Reimer, W Fleischer, B Brögmann, H Schreier, P Burkhard, A Lanzendörfer, H Gümbel, H Hoekstra, W Behrens-Baumann,Povidone-iodine liposomes--an overview.,Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland),1997<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9403264/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9403264/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
