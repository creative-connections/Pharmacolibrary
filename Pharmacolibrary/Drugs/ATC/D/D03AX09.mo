    </table><p>Crilanomer is a topical wound healing agent classified under ATC code D03AX09. It was investigated as a polymeric compound intended for dermatological use, most notably in the treatment of chronic wounds and ulcers. There is no evidence that crilanomer is approved or widely used today; its development appears to have been discontinued and it is not generally available.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human or animal pharmacokinetic data for crilanomer are available. No clinical studies describing its absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion have been found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
