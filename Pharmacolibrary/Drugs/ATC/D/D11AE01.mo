It is not approved for use in most countries today due to its significant side effect profile and high abuse potential.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated typical adult values for oral administration in healthy young males, based on available pharmacological texts and review articles as published direct PK studies and models are not found in the literature.
