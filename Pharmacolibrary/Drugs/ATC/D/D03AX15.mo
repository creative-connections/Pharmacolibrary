It promotes wound healing by stimulating cell proliferation and angiogenesis.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies or clinical PK modeling of trafermin (rhbFGF) in humans were identified as of 2024. Trafermin is typically administered topically, and systemic absorption is believed to be minimal; pharmacokinetic parameters have not been reported in the literature for this drug.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
