Its medical use is now limited and largely replaced by safer, more effective agents; it is rarely used in modern clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in humans were found. Potassium permanganate is applied topically for dermatological uses; systemic absorption is minimal under normal conditions. No PK model parameters are reported in scientific literature for this route or compound.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>White, RJ, et al., &amp; Kingsley, A (2006).
