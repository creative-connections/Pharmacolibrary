Its use is mainly for cosmetic purposes to unify skin color in patients with widespread vitiligo. Monobenzone is not widely used or approved for general use today due to its irreversible action and risk of conferring sensitivity to sunlight.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data on monobenzone in humans have been identified.
