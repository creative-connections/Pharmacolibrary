It is a prescription medication and approved for dermatological use in several countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No human pharmacokinetic (PK) studies specifically for hydrocortisone buteprate have been published. Its PK parameters are not available in clinical literature; estimates could be made based on systemic corticosteroid absorption through skin, but topical steroids are intended for minimal systemic absorption.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Y Ozawa, T Yamahira, H Sunada, T Nadai,Influence of fatty acid-alcohol esters on percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone butyrate propionate.,Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,1988<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3240451/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3240451/</a></li><li>Y Ozawa, I Koyama, S Murayama, T Nadai,Percutaneous absorption and metabolism of hydrocortisone butyrate propionate in dog skin.,Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,1985<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3830438/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3830438/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
