It has activity against a broad spectrum of fungi but is not widely approved or in clinical use in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters have been reported for lanoconazole in human subjects. Lanoconazole is administered topically and is intended for local action with minimal systemic absorption.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No human pharmacokinetic studies for lanoconazole could be found in the literature as of 2024. All PK parameters are estimated based on the drugâ€™s topical administration, low systemic absorption, and product summaries. Bioavailability is assumed to be <1% based on analogy with similar topical imidazole antifungals.</li></ol></body></html>",
