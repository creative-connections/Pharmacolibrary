It is effective against dermatophytes, yeasts, and molds. Combinations with other agents are used in some topical formulations. Bifonazole is approved for over-the-counter use in several countries for dermatological mycoses.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for topical administration in adults. No published compartmental model studies specifically for combinations with bifonazole (ATC D01AC60) were found; estimates are extrapolated from single-agent topical bifonazole data in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Miranda, M, et al., &amp; Vitorino, C (2023).
