It is effective against dermatophytes, yeasts, and molds. Combinations with other agents are used in some topical formulations. Bifonazole is approved for over-the-counter use in several countries for dermatological mycoses.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for topical administration in adults.
