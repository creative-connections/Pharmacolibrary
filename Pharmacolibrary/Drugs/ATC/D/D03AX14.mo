    info ="<html><body><p>Centella asiatica herba, also known as Gotu Kola, is a medicinal plant traditionally used for wound healing, venous insufficiency, and as a cognitive enhancer. It is present in various topical and oral pharmaceutical preparations, including combinations for wound treatments under ATC code D03AX14. The use of Centella-based medications for wound healing is well-established in herbal medicine, but distinct pharmaceutical approvals vary by region.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No primary human pharmacokinetic studies directly characterizing Centella asiatica herba extract or its standardized combinations under D03AX14 found in the scientific literature.
