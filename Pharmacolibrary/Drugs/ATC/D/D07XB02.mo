Values are best estimates from intravenous and oral PK studies for triamcinolone acetonide in healthy adults and common corticosteroid class parameters. Topical bioavailability is very low and varies (estimated ~1â€“5%). Dose and parameters are indicative for a typical high-dose dermal application scenario. Further details would require specific study data.</li></ol></body></html>",
