It inhibits viral DNA synthesis. It is no longer widely approved or used in current clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters in humans are available from published studies. Edoxudine was mostly administered topically in ophthalmic preparations; therefore, systemic absorption and thus detailed pharmacokinetic modeling is not available. Estimates below are theoretical and based on topical application assumptions.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Spruance, SL, et al., &amp; Sheth, NV (1985).
