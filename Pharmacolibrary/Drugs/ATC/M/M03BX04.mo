It is not approved in the United States, but is widely used in several European and Asian countries. Tolperisone is primarily used to treat increased muscle tone due to neurological disorders and to alleviate muscle spasms.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are reported for healthy adult volunteers following single oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40268-014-0072-9'>10.1007/s40268-014-0072-9</a> Pharmacokinetic parameters were extracted from 'Tolperisone: pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy subjects and in patients with spasticity' (Clinical Pharmacokinetics. 2014;53(12):1231â€“1240). Oral bioavailability of tolperisone is low (~20%). Vd/F and Cl/F are high, indicating rapid clearance and extensive tissue distribution. Only limited PK data are available; reported parameters relate to oral administration in healthy adults.</li></ol></body></html>",
