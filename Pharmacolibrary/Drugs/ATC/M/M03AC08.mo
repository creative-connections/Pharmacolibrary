    info ="<html><body><p>Fazadinium bromide is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that was used to induce muscle relaxation during surgical procedures or mechanical ventilation. It acts as a competitive antagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The drug is no longer widely used or approved in most countries due to the development of safer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy adult individuals based on typical ranges for similar non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents; no direct pharmacokinetic publications or sources found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Pastorino, AM (1978).
