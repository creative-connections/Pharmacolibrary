    info       = "<html><body><table><tr><td>ATC code:</td><td>M01AX21</td></tr><td>route:</td><td>oral</td></tr><tr><td>n-compartments</td><td>1</td></tr></table><p>Diacerein is an anthraquinone derivative with anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoarthritic properties. It is primarily used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, especially in Europe and some other countries. Diacerein acts through inhibition of interleukin-1 and has been used as an alternative to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Its use is approved in some regions but is limited or withdrawn in others due to gastrointestinal side effects.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported in healthy adult volunteers after single oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Sharma, A, et al., &amp; Baliga, VP (2008).
