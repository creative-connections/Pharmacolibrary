Indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in adults, mainly postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. The combination is approved and available in some countries as a sequential regimen.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Population pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for sequential administration in healthy postmenopausal females based on component data; no dedicated published PK studies found for the three-drug combination, so the reported parameters are estimated from known PK of risedronic acid given orally as a single agent.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
