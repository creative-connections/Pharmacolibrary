    info ="<html><body><p>Sodium aurotiosulfate is a gold(I)-containing compound that was historically used as an antirheumatic agent, primarily for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It functions as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). Its use today is generally obsolete and has been replaced by better-tolerated and more effective agents.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No primary pharmacokinetic studies on sodium aurotiosulfate in humans are available in biomedical literature. Thus, all pharmacokinetic parameters below are estimated based on analogies with other gold-based DMARDs such as sodium aurothiomalate and provided for reference only.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Ferraccioli, GF, et al., &amp; Manganelli, P (1989).
