Currently, mephenesin has largely been replaced by newer agents with improved safety profiles and is not widely approved or used in modern clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>There are no well-documented modern pharmacokinetic studies or original clinical publications reporting the PK parameters of mephenesin in humans.
