    info ="<html><body><p>A fixed combination regimen used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in adults, particularly postmenopausal women and older men. Alendronic acid is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption, calcium is essential for bone mineralization, and colecalciferol (vitamin D3) improves calcium absorption. This combination provides a comprehensive approach to bone health. The sequential regimen is approved and in clinical use for osteoporosis management.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies reporting population PK parameters for the fixed sequential combination of alendronic acid, calcium, and colecalciferol. Single-agent data were used to estimate parameters: healthy adults, both sexes, typical oral dose.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
