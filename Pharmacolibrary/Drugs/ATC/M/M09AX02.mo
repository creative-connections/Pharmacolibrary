This therapy is approved and in use for patients with focal cartilage injuries to restore joint function and delay progression to osteoarthritis.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No conventional pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as bioavailability, clearance, or volume of distribution are relevant for autologous chondrocytes since they are living cells administered via intra-articular implantation for local effect.
