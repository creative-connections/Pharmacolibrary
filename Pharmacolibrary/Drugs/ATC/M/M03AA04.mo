It acts as a non-depolarizing blocker at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Its use has been largely replaced by newer agents with a better safety profile and it is not commonly approved for modern clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Parameters estimated for typical adult, intravenous administration.
