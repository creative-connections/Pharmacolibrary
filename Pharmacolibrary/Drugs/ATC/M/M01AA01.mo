Due to its significant side effect profile, especially risk of agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia, its human use is now severely restricted or withdrawn in many countries, though it remains in use in veterinary medicine.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Healthy adult volunteers, single oral dose pharmacokinetics</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2125.1975.tb00227.x'>10.1111/j.1365-2125.1975.tb00227.x</a> Parameters sourced from classical pharmacokinetic studies of phenylbutazone in healthy adults.
