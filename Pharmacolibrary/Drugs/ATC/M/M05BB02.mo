Risedronic acid (risedronate) is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption, while calcium provides a supplement to maintain bone health. It is approved and in use today for osteoporosis management.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for typical adult population as no direct sources found for the fixed-dose combination; values are primarily based on risedronic acid (risedronate) data for healthy adults administered orally. Calcium component does not impact risedronate PK if taken sequentially.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
