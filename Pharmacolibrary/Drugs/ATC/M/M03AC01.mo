It is typically administered intravenously and acts by antagonizing acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions. Pancuronium is still used in clinical anesthesia, though alternatives with different durations or metabolism are often chosen today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for adult surgical patients, both male and female, with normal renal and hepatic function.
