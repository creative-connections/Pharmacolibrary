    </table><p>Carisoprodol is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that blocks pain sensations between the nerves and the brain. It is primarily used for the short-term relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in adults. Carisoprodol is a controlled substance due to its potential for abuse and dependence; in many countries, its use has been reduced or discontinued. In the United States, carisoprodol remains approved for prescription use for up to two or three weeks at a time.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported in healthy adult volunteers following single oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Heltsley, R, et al., &amp; Cone, EJ (2011).
