    info ="<html><body><p>Clofezone is a combination drug consisting of clofexamide (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID) and phenylbutazone, previously used as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain and arthritis, primarily in Europe. It is no longer widely marketed or approved due to concerns about safety, especially related to phenylbutazone.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for clofezone have not been reported in published literature. The following values are rough estimates based on pharmacokinetic properties of structurally/functionally related NSAIDs (e.g., phenylbutazone, clofexamide). Parameters represent adults, typical oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Reinicke, C, et al., &amp; Wessel, G (1984).
