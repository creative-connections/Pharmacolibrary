It is oil-based, intended for visualization of the lymphatic system. Adipiodone is no longer widely used due to advances in water-soluble contrast agents and concerns regarding safety and tissue irritation.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for adipiodone are not reported in peer-reviewed literature. The following values are estimated based on the drug class (oil-based iodinated contrast agents) and typical clinical administration in adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
