The drug is not widely used today due to the availability of non-invasive imaging techniques and safer, more effective contrast agents. It is not currently approved or commonly employed in clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameter data specific to iobenzamic acid in humans was found in available literature as of 2024.
