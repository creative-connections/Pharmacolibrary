    info       = "<html><body><table><tr><td>ATC code:</td><td>V04CX03</td></tr><td>route:</td><td>inhalation</td></tr><tr><td>n-compartments</td><td>1</td></tr></table><p>Methacholine is a synthetic choline ester that acts as a non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist. It is primarily used in the diagnosis of bronchial hyperreactivity (asthma) in the form of a methacholine challenge test. Methacholine is not used as a therapeutic drug; its approved use is in diagnostic procedures.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No direct human pharmacokinetic data published; estimates based on available limited animal and in vitro data. Methacholine exhibits rapid metabolism by cholinesterases and an extremely short plasma half-life. Typically administered via inhalation during bronchoprovocation challenge tests.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Short, PM, et al., &amp; Lipworth, BJ (2015).
