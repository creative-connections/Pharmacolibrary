It functions by enhancing the radiographic contrast of bile and hepatic structures. The drug is no longer widely used today due to the introduction of safer and more effective imaging agents.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates for tyropanoic acid in humans are available in the published literature as of 2024.
