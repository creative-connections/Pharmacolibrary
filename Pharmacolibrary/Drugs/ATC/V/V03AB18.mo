It is currently used in diluted solutions for topical use only. It is not systemically administered in modern medical practice due to toxicity.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed publications providing pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in humans for potassium permanganate as a drug were identified. Systemic administration is not a recognized clinical use as it is only approved for topical/local external administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>White, RJ, et al., &amp; Kingsley, A (2006).
