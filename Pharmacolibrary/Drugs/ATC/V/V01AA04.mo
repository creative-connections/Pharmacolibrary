The drug is classified under ATC code V01AA04 as 'Mould and yeast (except baker's yeast)'. Currently, these preparations are rarely used and not universally approved due to advances in specific allergen extracts and safety profiles.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No referenced pharmacokinetic studies are available for 'mould fungus and yeast fungus' preparations, as these are complex allergen extracts designed for immunotherapy rather than systemic absorption or classic pharmacokinetics. No peer-reviewed publications report human pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Chen, JH, et al., &amp; Wang, M (2010).
