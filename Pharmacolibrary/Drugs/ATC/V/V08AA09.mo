It is a water-soluble derivative of iodinated aromatic compounds. Due to the development of safer and less toxic contrast agents, methiodal is no longer in clinical use and is considered obsolete.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published original pharmacokinetic studies with detailed parameters for methiodal in humans have been identified.
