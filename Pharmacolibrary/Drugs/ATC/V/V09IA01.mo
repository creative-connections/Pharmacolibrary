It is administered as a radiopharmaceutical agent for tumor localization using nuclear medicine techniques. Its clinical use is limited and not widespread today, with most imaging procedures replaced by more advanced PET/CT agents.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for technetium (99mTc) antiCEA antibody based on typical monoclonal antibody behavior in adults.
