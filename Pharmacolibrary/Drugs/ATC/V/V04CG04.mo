It is not widely used therapeutically and has largely been replaced by other diagnostic methods.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No direct human pharmacokinetic model or validated parameters could be identified in the scientific literature for pentagastrin. Available published literature focuses mainly on its pharmacodynamic effects and diagnostic use, rather than PK modeling. Below are rough estimates based on the drugâ€™s peptide structure, rapid onset of action following injection, and physicochemical properties.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
