The drug is classified under X-ray contrast media, specifically as a high-osmolar ionic contrast agent. It is not widely used today due to the development of safer, lower-osmolar, non-ionic contrast agents.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data available; parameters estimated based on typical properties of high-osmolar ionic iodinated radiographic contrast agents in adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Nagel, R, et al., &amp; Clauss, W (1978).
