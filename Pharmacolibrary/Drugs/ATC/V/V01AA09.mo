    info ="<html><body><p>Textiles (ATC code V01AA09) refers to specialized fabrics used in medical applications, particularly in diagnostic skin tests such as tuberculin skin testing or allergy testing. These are non-pharmacological agents used to deliver or hold diagnostic preparations on the skin, rather than conventional drugs acting via pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics. Textiles are not considered therapeutic drugs and do not undergo systemic absorption as APIs do. They are not approved, marketed, or used today for any direct pharmacological effect but are rather auxiliary materials in certain diagnostic procedures.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic model or parameters apply, as 'textiles' under ATC V01AA09 are not pharmacologically active drugs but auxiliary materials for diagnostic skin testing in general healthy and patient adult populations.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>A K DÄ…browska, F Spano, S Derler, C Adlhart, N D Spencer, R M Rossi,The relationship between skin function, barrier properties, and body-dependent factors.,Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging (ISSI),2018<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29057509/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29057509/</a></li><li>Matin Rostamitabar, Abdelrahman M Abdelgawad, Stefan Jockenhoevel, Samaneh Ghazanfari,Drug-Eluting Medical Textiles: From Fiber Production and Textile Fabrication to Drug Loading and Delivery.,Macromolecular bioscience,2021<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33951278/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33951278/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
