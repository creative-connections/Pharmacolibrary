It is not a routinely used drug today due to newer agents and procedural advances, but may be used in specific settings for palliative therapy of joint pain.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>There are currently no published pharmacokinetic models with reported parameters for yttrium (90Y) citrate colloid in humans. Estimates below are based on general properties of radio-colloids and parenteral radiopharmaceuticals.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Schmid, E, et al., &amp; Haney, M (2006).
