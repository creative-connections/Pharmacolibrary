Administered intravenously, it delivers targeted radiation to PSMA-expressing cancer cells. It is approved for clinical use in certain advanced prostate cancers.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported in adult male patients with PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following intravenous administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.121.263409'>10.2967/jnumed.121.263409</a> Pharmacokinetic estimates are taken from published data for lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan (PLUVICTO) in mCRPC patients, supporting a two-compartment model (Kratochwil et al., J Nucl Med. 2022; 63(4): 510â€“516).
