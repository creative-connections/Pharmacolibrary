    info ="<html><body><p>Ethanol (ethyl alcohol) is a psychoactive substance commonly found in alcoholic beverages. It acts as a central nervous system depressant. Medically, ethanol has been used as an antidote for methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning, and as a disinfectant. It is not prescribed as a therapeutic agent for routine patient use in current practice outside its role in toxicology.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy adult humans after oral administration of ethanol. There is considerable interindividual variability due to factors such as sex, age, body composition, and chronic alcohol use.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002280050285'>10.1007/s002280050285</a> Parameters taken from studies such as Norberg et al., 'Role of variability in body water and hepatic blood flow in describing ethanol pharmacokinetics: gender differences and implications for pharmacotherapy.'
