    info ="<html><body><p>Technetium (99mTc) arcitumomab is a radiopharmaceutical agent composed of a murine monoclonal antibody (arcitumomab) labeled with the radionuclide technetium-99m. It binds to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and is used in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer through gamma imaging to localize CEA-expressing tumors. It is not widely used today due to the development of more advanced imaging agents.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed publications with detailed pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., clearance, volume of distribution) for technetium (99mTc) arcitumomab in humans are available as of 2024-06. Dosing is reported to be typically intravenous, with imaging conducted 2â€“5 hours post-injection.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
