    </table><p>Secretin is a peptide hormone produced in the duodenum that regulates water homeostasis and stimulates the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluids. Clinically, synthetic or porcine secretin has been used as a diagnostic agent to stimulate pancreatic secretions in the evaluation of pancreatic exocrine function and in diagnostic tests for gastrinoma (Zollingerâ€“Ellison syndrome). The use of secretin as a therapeutic agent is currently limited and it is not widely approved outside of diagnostic use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for intravenous administration in healthy adult individuals; no direct peer-reviewed publication of pharmacokinetics has been identified.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
