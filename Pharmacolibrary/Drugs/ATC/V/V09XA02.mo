It is used mainly in nuclear medicine. The use of 131I-iodocholesterol has decreased due to the development of newer imaging techniques and radioisotopes.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models with explicit compartment, volume of distribution, or clearance values for iodocholesterol (131I) in humans have been found. Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on reported biological half-life and typical radiotracer doses in healthy adults for adrenal imaging.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
