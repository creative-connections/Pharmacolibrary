It is not used therapeutically and serves as a tracer. Despite its diagnostic utility, 124I has not received widespread regulatory approval as standard of care due to its relatively limited availability and high cost compared to other iodine isotopes.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are reported in adult patients (both sexes) undergoing PET imaging for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Parameters typically relate to healthy adults or patients post-thyroidectomy without severe renal or hepatic impairment.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Kang, JH, et al., &amp; Lee, MC (2005).
