    info ="<html><body><p>Ibritumomab tiuxetan (90Y) is a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 antigen on B cells. It is used as a radioimmunotherapy for treatment of certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Its use is currently limited and it is not widely approved or available in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are primarily derived from adult cancer patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, both sexes, aged 18-80, without major renal or hepatic insufficiency.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2003.03.079'>10.1200/JCO.2003.03.079</a> Parameters based on published pharmacokinetic data from patients with non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma (e.g., Wiseman GA, White CA, Stabin M et al.
