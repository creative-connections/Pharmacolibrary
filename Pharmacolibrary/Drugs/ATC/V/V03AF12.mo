Trilaciclib is FDA-approved for this indication. It is not used as an anticancer agent directly, but as a myeloprotective agent to help patients tolerate myelosuppressive chemotherapy.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Population pharmacokinetic model for adult cancer patients (predominantly ES-SCLC) receiving intravenous trilaciclib; parameters from first-in-human, phase 2, and phase 3 studies.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2460'>10.1002/cpt.2460</a> Primary pharmacokinetic parameters sourced from 'Population Pharmacokinetics and Exposureâ€“Response Analyses of Trilaciclib, an Intravenous Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 Inhibitor, in Patients With Cancer' (CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol. 2021, DOI: 10.1002/cpt.2460).
