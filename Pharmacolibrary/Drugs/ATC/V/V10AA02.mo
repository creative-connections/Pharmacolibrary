It is usually injected intra-articularly to treat chronic synovitis. Its use is limited to certain specialist centers and is not widely approved for all types of arthritis treatment.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No detailed human pharmacokinetic studies have been published for yttrium (90Y) ferrihydroxide colloid. The general PK is described from radiocolloid particle kinetics after intra-articular injection, where systemic absorption is minimal and most of the radioactivity remains localized within the joint for weeks to months. Typical values not reported in the literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
