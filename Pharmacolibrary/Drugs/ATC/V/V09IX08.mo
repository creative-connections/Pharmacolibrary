It serves as an analog of choline and is utilized for the detection, staging, and restaging of malignancies with high choline uptake. It is not a therapeutic drug, but rather a diagnostic imaging agent, and is approved for clinical use in several countries for oncological PET imaging.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for typical adult male prostate cancer patients undergoing PET imaging.
