It is most commonly applied in sentinel lymph node mapping, liver-spleen scintigraphy, and bone marrow imaging. It is an approved and widely used diagnostic agent today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No detailed pharmacokinetic studies (e.g., model-based PK parameters) have been published for technetium (99mTc) microcolloid in humans. Absorption/distribution are based on intended imaging organ after intravenous or subcutaneous administration, and elimination mainly occurs via the reticuloendothelial system and subsequent excretion.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
