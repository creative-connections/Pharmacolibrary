It is a beta-emitting radioactive isotope, formerly used for palliative and therapeutic purposes. Its clinical use has declined significantly due to newer therapies and its serious side effect profile.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No direct human pharmacokinetic data or parameter values published in peer-reviewed literature for sodium phosphate (32P) could be found. Below are estimated pharmacokinetic parameters based on typical behavior of inorganic phosphate and radiopharmaceutical distribution in adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
