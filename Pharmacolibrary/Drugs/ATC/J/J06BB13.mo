    </table><p>Pertussis immunoglobulin is a human-derived immunoglobulin product that provides passive immunity against Bordetella pertussis, the bacterium responsible for whooping cough. It has been investigated and used previously as a prophylactic and therapeutic option mainly in high-risk infants or immunocompromised individuals, though it is not in widespread approved use today due to limited evidence and the efficacy of vaccination.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific pharmacokinetic studies or publications reporting detailed model parameters for pertussis immunoglobulin in humans could be found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
