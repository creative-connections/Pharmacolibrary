This vaccine consists of an attenuated strain of the virus and is administered to induce protective immunity. It is an approved vaccine in several countries and part of national immunization campaigns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are available for the live attenuated Japanese encephalitis vaccine as it is a biological immunogen that acts by provoking an immune response rather than through conventional PK processes typical for small molecule drugs. Therefore, classical PK parameters do not apply. These parameters are estimated as not applicable.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Wijesinghe, PR, et al., &amp; Victor, JC (2016).
