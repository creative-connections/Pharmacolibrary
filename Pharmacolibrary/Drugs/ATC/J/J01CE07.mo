It is structurally related to ampicillin and was primarily investigated for oral use. Clometocillin is no longer widely available or approved in modern clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult subjects, as direct published pharmacokinetic data for clometocillin are not available. Estimates are based on structural similarity to ampicillin and other aminopenicillins.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Rudzit, EA, et al., &amp; Nefedova, ZV (1977).
