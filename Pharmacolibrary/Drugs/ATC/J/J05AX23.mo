    </table><p>Ibalizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody used as an antiretroviral for the treatment of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection in adults. It acts as a post-attachment inhibitor by binding to domain 2 of the CD4 receptor on T-cells, thereby preventing HIV from entering cells. It was approved by the FDA in 2018 and is currently used in clinical practice for patients with limited treatment options due to resistance.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV-1-infected adults, both male and female, receiving standard dosing of ibalizumab intravenous infusion (initial 2000 mg loading dose followed by 800 mg every two weeks).</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Beran, C, et al., &amp; Sahloff, EG (2024).
