It is primarily administered to children and susceptible adults and is widely approved and used today for routine immunization against varicella in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>As a live attenuated virus vaccine, standard pharmacokinetic parameters such as bioavailability, volume of distribution, and clearance are not typically reported because the vaccine's effectiveness and behavior rely on immune response and replication of attenuated virus rather than drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. No published pharmacokinetic models for this vaccine exist.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
