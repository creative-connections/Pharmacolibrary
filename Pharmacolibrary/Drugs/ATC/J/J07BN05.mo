    info ="<html><body><p>COVID-19 virus-like particles (VLPs) are non-infectious particles that mimic the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus without containing its genetic material. These VLPs are primarily used as experimental or approved vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19, helping induce immune responses similar to natural infection, but with a favorable safety profile. As of 2024, several VLP-based COVID-19 vaccines have been evaluated and some are approved in specific regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No direct pharmacokinetic (PK) study has been published reporting systemic PK measurements for COVID-19 virus-like particle vaccines in humans, as these vaccines are intended for intramuscular administration and primarily act locally to stimulate immune responses rather than reach significant systemic levels.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
