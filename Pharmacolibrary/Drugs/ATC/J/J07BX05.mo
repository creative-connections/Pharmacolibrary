As of 2024, several RSV vaccines are approved for use, especially in older adults and pregnant women to protect newborns via passive immunity.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic (PK) studies report specific PK parameters for RSV vaccines (protein subunit, mRNA, or viral vector) in adults, children, or any population. As vaccines, their pharmacokinetics is generally characterized by immunological response kinetics rather than classic PK (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) relevant to small molecule drugs. PK parameters provided here are estimated or marked as not applicable for typical vaccine intramuscular administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Zhu, Q, et al., &amp; Suzich, JA (2017).
