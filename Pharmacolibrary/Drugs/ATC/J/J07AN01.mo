It is used for the prevention of tuberculosis (TB), especially severe forms in children, and is still approved and used today in many countries where TB is endemic.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>There are no published pharmacokinetic models or parameter values for live attenuated BCG vaccine, as vaccines of this type do not distribute and clear in the body in a manner similar to small molecule drugs; they act primarily by inducing an immune response at the site of administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Price, DN, et al., &amp; Muttil, P (2019).
