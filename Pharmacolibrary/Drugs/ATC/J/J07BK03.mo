    info ="<html><body><p>Zoster, purified antigen (subunit vaccine), is an inactivated recombinant vaccine based on herpes zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE) combined with an adjuvant system. It is used to prevent shingles (herpes zoster) and its complications, particularly in adults aged 50 years and older. A well-known example is Shingrix, which is approved and widely used today for immunization against shingles.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters are available in the literature for zoster, purified antigen vaccine. As a non-replicating recombinant protein administered intramuscularly, systemic pharmacokinetics are not typically measurable in terms of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion as applied to small-molecule drugs. Any pharmacokinetic properties would be theoretical or based on other protein vaccines with similar administration routes.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
