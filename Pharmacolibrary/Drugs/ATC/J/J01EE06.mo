Sulfadiazine is a sulfonamide antibiotic, while tetroxoprim is a diaminopyrimidine derivative. The combination is primarily used in veterinary medicine and is rarely used in human medicine today; it does not have current approval for use in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies are available for the fixed-dose combination of sulfadiazine and tetroxoprim in humans; estimated parameters based on analogous trimethoprim-sulfadiazine combinations and known PK data for the individual components in adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
