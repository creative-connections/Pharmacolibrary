It is typically administered as part of combined vaccines (e.g., DTaP, Tdap). It is approved and used in many countries for routine immunization of infants, children, and adults.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters are available for purified antigen pertussis vaccines as they are vaccines comprising protein antigens for immunization, not small molecule drugs.
