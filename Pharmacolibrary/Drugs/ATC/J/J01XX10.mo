    </table><p>Bacitracin is a polypeptide antibiotic primarily used for topical treatment of skin infections. It is active against Gram-positive bacteria and is rarely used systemically because of nephrotoxicity. It is generally used as a topical ointment or eye/ear drops and is approved for topical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters, as bacitracin is not administered systemically in humans due to toxicity and there are no published human PK models for IV/IM/oral administration. Most administration is topical, with negligible systemic absorption.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
