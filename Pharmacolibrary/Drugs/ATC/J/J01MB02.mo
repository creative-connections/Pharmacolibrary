It is primarily effective against Gram-negative bacteria and was initially used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, due to widespread resistance and the development of newer fluoroquinolones with better efficacy and safety profiles, nalidixic acid is rarely used today and is no longer approved or recommended in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers after a single oral dose.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Murata, K, et al., &amp; Samejima, M (1989).
