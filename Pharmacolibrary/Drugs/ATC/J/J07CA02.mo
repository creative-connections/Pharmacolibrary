Used for immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and poliomyelitis, especially in children. This vaccine is widely approved and used for routine vaccination in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic model parameters are reported for combined diphtheria-pertussis-poliomyelitis-tetanus vaccines in the literature, as these are inactivated/toxoid vaccines rather than typical chemical drugs. Pharmacokinetic parameters (volume of distribution, clearance, etc.) are not generally applicable to vaccines; instead, immunogenicity and antibody response are measured. Estimates below are left empty or not applicable.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
