It has been principally studied for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, generally in combination with other antivirals (such as sofosbuvir). As of 2024, ravidasvir has not been approved by major regulatory agencies (such as FDA or EMA), but has been utilized in clinical trials, especially in developing countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated typical pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult subjects based on information from clinical trials (primarily ALIGN and STORM-C-1 studies), since no specific comprehensive publication reporting detailed compartmental PK parameters is available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Panjasawatwong, N, et al., &amp; Cressey, TR (2024).
