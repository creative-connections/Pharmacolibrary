    info ="<html><body><p>This ATC group refers to fixed drug combinations that contain at least one tetracycline antibiotic, usually for oral use in the treatment of various bacterial infections. Such combinations were used in the past for synergy or broader antimicrobial coverage, but most are now rarely used due to resistance development and the availability of newer, more effective treatments. No specific combination product under J01AA20 is currently widely approved or in regular therapeutic use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for an oral combination of tetracyclines in a typical adult population, based on known single-compound tetracycline kinetics; no direct published PK study for combination products was found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Amanda K Sullins, Susan M Abdel-Rahman,Pharmacokinetics of antibacterial agents in the CSF of children and adolescents.,Paediatric drugs,2013<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23529866/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23529866/</a></li><li>Ryan K Shields, David L Paterson, Pranita D Tamma,Navigating Available Treatment Options for Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus Complex Infections.,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2023<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37125467/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37125467/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
