It was used as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for mumps infection, particularly before the availability of mumps vaccines. It is not commonly used today due to the widespread use of effective mumps vaccination.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific published pharmacokinetic data exist for mumps immunoglobulin.
