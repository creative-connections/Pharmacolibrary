It is used to prevent infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is routinely recommended for infants, children, and at-risk adults worldwide. It is approved and widely used in immunization programs globally.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters for purified hepatitis B antigen vaccine in healthy adults or other populations are reported in published literature. As a protein antigen administered via intramuscular injection, it is not absorbed or distributed in the manner typical of small molecule drugs.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Sawada, H, et al., &amp; Kitano, K (1995).
