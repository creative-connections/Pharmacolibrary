It was used as a post-exposure prophylactic therapy for TBE infection, particularly in endemic regions. Due to risk of antibody-dependent enhancement and lack of evidence for efficacy, its use has been discontinued and is not currently approved in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies specific to tick borne encephalitis immunoglobulin (ATC J06BB12) could be located.
