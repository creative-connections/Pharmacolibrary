    info       = "<html><body><table><tr><td>Drug:</td><td>J06BB12</td></tr><td>route:</td><td>intramuscular</td></tr><tr><td>n-compartments</td><td>2</td></tr></table><p>Tick borne encephalitis immunoglobulin is a human immunoglobulin preparation derived from plasma of donors immunized against the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus. It was used as a post-exposure prophylactic therapy for TBE infection, particularly in endemic regions. Due to risk of antibody-dependent enhancement and lack of evidence for efficacy, its use has been discontinued and is not currently approved in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies specific to tick borne encephalitis immunoglobulin (ATC J06BB12) could be located. As such, PK parameters are estimated based on data from similar human immunoglobulin G intravenous (IVIg) products administered to healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Adner, N, et al., &amp; Wahlberg, T (2001).
