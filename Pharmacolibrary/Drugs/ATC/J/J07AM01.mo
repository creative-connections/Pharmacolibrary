    </table><p>Tetanus toxoid is an inactivated form of the tetanus toxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It is used as a vaccine to induce immunity against tetanus, a potentially fatal neuromuscular disease. Tetanus toxoid is widely approved and used globally for both prophylactic and post-exposure immunization.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adults following standard intramuscular vaccination, as no detailed PK model is reported in the scientific literature since tetanus toxoid acts as an antigen and not a classical drug.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
