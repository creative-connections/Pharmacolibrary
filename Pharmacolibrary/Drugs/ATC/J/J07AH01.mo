These vaccines are primarily used for immunization in at-risk populations where serogroup A outbreaks are epidemiologically significant. The product is currently approved and used in meningococcal vaccine formulations.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models exist for purified polysaccharide meningococcal A antigen in humans. As a vaccine antigen, its action is based on immunological induction rather than classical systemic pharmacokinetics; absorption and distribution result in antigen uptake by antigen-presenting cells at the site of injection, with minimal systemic levels and no classic PK modeling reported.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
