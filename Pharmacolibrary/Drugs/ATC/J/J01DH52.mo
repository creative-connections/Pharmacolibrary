This combination is used for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, caused by susceptible Gram-negative bacteria. The combination is approved for clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are described for healthy adult subjects (average age ~35 years, both sexes) after intravenous administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.02441-17'>10.1128/AAC.02441-17</a> Pharmacokinetic parameters are referenced from the study 'Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Meropenem-Vaborbactam' (Wiskirchen et al., 2017, Antimicrob Agents Chemother).
