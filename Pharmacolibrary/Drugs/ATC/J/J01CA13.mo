    info       = "<html><body><table><tr><td>ATC code:</td><td>J01CA13</td></tr><td>route:</td><td>intravenous</td></tr><tr><td>n-compartments</td><td>2</td></tr></table><p>Ticarcillin is a broad-spectrum, semi-synthetic penicillin antibiotic primarily used for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria. It is historically used in the management of serious infections such as those due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ticarcillin is often combined with clavulanic acid to overcome beta-lactamase-mediated resistance. It has largely been replaced by other agents in many therapeutic settings, but may still be used in some hospitals.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetics in healthy adult volunteers following intravenous administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Massie, J, &amp; Cranswick, N (2006).
