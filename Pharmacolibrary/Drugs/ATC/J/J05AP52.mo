    info ="<html><body><p>Dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir is a fixed-dose combination regimen used as antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Paritaprevir (an NS3/4A protease inhibitor) is boosted with ritonavir (a CYP3A inhibitor), ombitasvir is an NS5A inhibitor, and dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor. This fixed combination (also marketed as Viekira Pak) is approved for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 and was widely used but has been largely superseded by newer regimens.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult subjects after oral administration (fed state). Parameters are predominantly derived from population PK and single/multiple dose studies.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.03564-14'>10.1128/AAC.03564-14</a> Pharmacokinetic parameters are primarily for paritaprevir (boosted with ritonavir) as representative for the combination therapy, obtained from phase I and population PK studies. Similar PK profiles are reported for other components. See Khatri A et al. (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2015;59(5):2412â€“20). Values for ombitasvir, dasabuvir, and ritonavir differ but are in similar ranges.</li></ol></body></html>",
