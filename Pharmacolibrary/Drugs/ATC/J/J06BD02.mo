It was developed for the prevention of RSV infection in high-risk infants and children; however, motavizumab is not currently approved for use due to regulatory concerns and insufficient demonstration of clinical benefit over palivizumab.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for typical healthy pediatric patients based on reported data for IgG monoclonal antibodies of similar type, as there are no peer-reviewed, published PK parameters specifically for motavizumab.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Robbie, GJ, et al., &amp; Griffin, MP (2013).
