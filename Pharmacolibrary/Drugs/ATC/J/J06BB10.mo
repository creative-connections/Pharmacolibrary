It is administered to individuals exposed to Corynebacterium diphtheriae or with suspected or confirmed diphtheria infection for immediate toxin neutralization. This product is approved for use in some countries, but its use has declined in areas with widespread vaccination.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies in humans with parameter values for diphtheria immunoglobulin were identified.
