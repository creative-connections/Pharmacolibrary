    info ="<html><body><p>Lysozyme is a naturally occurring enzyme found in bodily secretions such as saliva, tears, and mucus, where it acts as part of the innate immune system by breaking down the cell walls of bacteria. Pharmaceutically, it has been used for its mild antibacterial and anti-inflammatory actions, but it is not widely approved as a stand-alone systemic drug in modern therapy and is rarely used in clinical practice today, though it may still be found in lozenges and topical products in some countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic (PK) model parameters were identified for systemic administration of lysozyme. PK parameters therefore estimated based on typical properties of similar low-molecular weight proteins and available preclinical evidence.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Junya Nagai, Takayuki Katsube, Teruo Murakami, Mikihisa Takano,Effect of gentamicin on pharmacokinetics of lysozyme in rats: interaction between megalin substrates in the kidney.,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,2002<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12495551/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12495551/</a></li><li>Ziyan Chen, Wentao Cao, Yating Liu, Haibo Liu, Jing Ru, Mengting Yin, Xiong Luo, Yiming Zhang, Feng Chen,Hydrogel microspheres encapsulating lysozyme/MXene for photothermally enhanced antibacterial activity and infected wound healing.,International journal of biological macromolecules,2024<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39265907/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39265907/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
