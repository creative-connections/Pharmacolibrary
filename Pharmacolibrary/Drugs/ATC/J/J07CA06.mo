It is used as a routine immunization in children and is approved and recommended in many countries for pediatric use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published studies directly reporting detailed pharmacokinetic parameters for the DTP-Hib-Polio-Tetanus combination vaccine in humans. The components are antigens and toxoids, not small molecules, and pharmacokinetics are typically not measured for vaccines as for drugs. Parameters such as volume of distribution or clearance are generally not applicable.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
