It is a heterocyclic biguanide compound with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, though its clinical use today is limited or not widely adopted globally and it is not approved in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>There are no available peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic (PK) publications reporting specific PK parameters for moroxydine in humans. The following are estimated typical values based on its chemical and pharmacological class (biguanidines, comparable to metformin) and its oral use in historical contexts.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Liu, W, et al., &amp; Zeng, L (2016).
