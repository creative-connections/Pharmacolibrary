It is used to prevent invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroup A. The vaccine is approved and widely used, especially in regions where serogroup A meningococcal outbreaks are common.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic studies or data available in the literature for purified Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A polysaccharide conjugate vaccines. As a vaccine, the product works via immunogenicity rather than traditional PK properties such as plasma concentration and elimination.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
