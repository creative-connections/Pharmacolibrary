Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic and oleandomycin is a macrolide antibiotic. This combination is not widely used and is not approved in major markets as of today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic data for the fixed combination is reported in the literature. Estimates are based on the individual pharmacokinetics of tetracycline and oleandomycin in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Ludden, TM (1985).
