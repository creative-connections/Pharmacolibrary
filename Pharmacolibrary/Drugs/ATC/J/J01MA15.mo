It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes key to DNA replication. Gemifloxacin was previously approved in several countries, including the US and EU, but is now withdrawn in some regions due to safety concerns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy adult volunteers (both male and female, fasting conditions, single oral dose, ages 18-50).</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40262-013-0073-3'>10.1007/s40262-013-0073-3</a> Parameters extracted from table 1 and 2, 'Clinical pharmacokinetics of gemifloxacin', Clin Pharmacokinet (2014) 53:321â€“338.</li></ol></body></html>",
