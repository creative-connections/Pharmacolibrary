It works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. Miconazole is approved for clinical use and is available in topical, oral, and intravenous formulations, though oral and intravenous usage is less common due to poor systemic absorption and adverse effects.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers after a single oral dose administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/009127007901900310'>10.1177/009127007901900310</a> PK parameters for miconazole after 250 mg oral administration in healthy volunteers were taken from the publication: 'Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability of Miconazole in Man'.
