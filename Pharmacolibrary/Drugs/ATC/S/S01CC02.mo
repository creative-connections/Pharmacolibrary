The combination aims to provide both anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects in the treatment of ocular conditions. Such combinations have been used in ophthalmology, although specific products may vary by country and are not universally approved worldwide.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies specific to the 'indometacin and antiinfectives' combinations administered ophthalmically have been identified. Pharmacokinetic parameters below are not available in the literature and cannot be accurately estimated due to the unique combination and route; thus, they are left empty.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Matthijs de Hoog, Johan W Mouton, John N van den Anker,Vancomycin: pharmacokinetics and administration regimens in neonates.,Clinical pharmacokinetics,2004<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15139793/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15139793/</a></li><li>Héctor Isaac Rocha-González, María Elena Sánchez-Mendoza, Leticia Cruz-Antonio, Francisco Javier Flores-Murrieta, Xochilt Itzel Cornelio-Huerta, Jesús Arrieta,Antinociceptive Interaction and Pharmacokinetics of the Combination Treatments of Methyleugenol Plus Diclofenac or Ketorolac.,Molecules (Basel, Switzerland),2020<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33153182/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33153182/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
