    </table><p>Iodoheparinate is an organoiodine compound once used as a contrast agent with anticoagulant properties, particularly in ophthalmology for procedures such as angiography. It is a derivative of heparin, enhanced with iodine for radiopacity. The drug is no longer widely used or approved in current clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data with reported parameters for iodoheparinate in humans were found. The following is an estimate based on typical values for similar heparin-derived contrast agents administered via parenteral (ocular/IV) routes.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
