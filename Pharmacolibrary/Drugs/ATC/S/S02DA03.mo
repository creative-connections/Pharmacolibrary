It is rarely used today due to the development of newer, safer alternatives and is not widely approved for use in modern medicine. In otology, phenazone is sometimes administered as otic drops in combination with other agents for the relief of ear pain.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers (mixed gender, ~20â€“50 years old).</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00547630'>10.1007/BF00547630</a> Parameters extracted from primary literature reporting single-dose pharmacokinetics of phenazone in healthy adults.
