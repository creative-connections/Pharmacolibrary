Initially developed for asthma and allergic eye conditions, it is now primarily used in ophthalmic preparations. Its use has become limited since the development of newer therapies, but nedocromil ophthalmic solution remains approved for allergic conjunctivitis in some regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for topical ophthalmic administration in adults.
