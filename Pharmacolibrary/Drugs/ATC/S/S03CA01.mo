It is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory ocular conditions with or at risk of superimposed infection. Ophthalmic use is still approved in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for topical ophthalmic administration in adults; no population PK model with published parameter values was foundâ€”values are estimated based on known properties of dexamethasone and similar ophthalmic suspensions.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No published population PK parameters for the combination ophthalmic formulation (S03CA01).
