These preparations are typically used topically to manage bacterial conjunctivitis and to reduce inflammation in the eye. Such combinations are approved for topical ophthalmic use in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters are available for topical ophthalmic administration in healthy adults. Due to the topical use, systemic absorption is minimal and clinical PK studies are not routinely published.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
