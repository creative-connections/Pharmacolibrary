Ophthalmic bacitracin (ATC: S01AA32) is used for bacterial eye infections. It is not absorbed systemically in significant quantities when applied topically or ophthalmically. Bacitracin is approved for topical and ophthalmic use but not for systemic use due to nephrotoxicity concerns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Bacitracin ophthalmic administration; pharmacokinetic parameters for humans are not established in the published literature due to minimal systemic absorption from ocular application.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Rabail Gul, Mariam Mir, Murtaza N Ali,An Appraisal of pH triggered Bacitracin drug release, through composite hydrogel systems.,Journal of biomaterials applications,2023<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36977474/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36977474/</a></li><li>Sumbla Sheikh, Alexander Sturzu, Hubert Kalbacher, Thomas Nagele, Christopher Weidenmaier, Marius Horger, Christian Schwentner, Ulrike Ernemann, Stefan Heckl,Fluorescein-labeled Bacitracin and Daptomycin Conjugates: Synthesis, Fluorescence Imaging and Evaluation.,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),2016<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27026529/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27026529/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
