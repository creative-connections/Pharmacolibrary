Due to significant side effects, including ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, as well as the development of resistance, it is rarely used in modern clinical practice and is not approved for human use in many regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic model parameters for dihydrostreptomycin with specific values were found. Estimates are provided based on its close similarity to streptomycin and general aminoglycoside pharmacokinetic properties in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>J Wers√§ll,Ototoxic antibiotics: a review.,Acta oto-laryngologica.
