It is no longer commonly in use and has generally been discontinued or replaced by newer corticosteroids. It is not currently approved for use in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data are available for medrysone in humans. The following pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on general corticosteroid ophthalmic pharmacokinetics and similarity to related glucocorticoids. Values are rough estimates, primarily for eye drops in adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
