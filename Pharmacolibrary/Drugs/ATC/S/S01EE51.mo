Latanoprost is a prostaglandin F2Î± analogue increasing uveoscleral outflow, while netarsudil is a Rho kinase inhibitor that reduces intraocular pressure by increasing trabecular outflow and decreasing episcleral venous pressure. The combination is approved and marketed under brand names such as Rocklatan or Roclanda.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters have been reported in the literature for the fixed combination of latanoprost and netarsudil (S01EE51) in humans.
