Due to resistance and adverse effects, its systemic human use is now rare and it is primarily used topically or in veterinary medicine. It is not currently a first-line approved drug for systemic human use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed human pharmacokinetic study available for chlortetracycline; pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on similarities with other tetracyclines and limited historical reports.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Kenneth N Agwuh, Alasdair MacGowan,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the tetracyclines including glycylcyclines.,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,2006<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16816396/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16816396/</a></li><li>Hubert Ziółkowski, Agnieszka Jasiecka-Mikołajczyk, Hanna Madej-Śmiechowska, Joanna Janiuk, Aleksandra Zygmuntowicz, Michał Dąbrowski,Comparative pharmacokinetics of chlortetracycline, tetracycline, minocycline, and tigecycline in broiler chickens.,Poultry science,2020<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32988509/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32988509/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
