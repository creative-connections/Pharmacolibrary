The ATC code S03CA05 refers to ocular antibiotic and corticosteroid combination products. This specific combination preparation (fludrocortisone and antiinfectives) is not widely described in major pharmacokinetic publications, is not commonly approved today, and information is limited.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published studies on pharmacokinetics of fludrocortisone and antiinfective combination with ATC code S03CA05. Estimates are provided based on fludrocortisone systemic parameters and considering topical (ocular) administration, which generally results in minimal systemic exposure.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
