It is an ophthalmic solution approved for use in adults. The drug is hydrolyzed in the eye to produce two active moieties: latanoprost acid and nitric oxide, both contributing to IOP reduction.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are not reported in peer-reviewed publications for latanoprostene bunod in humans.
