Interferon alfa is used therapeutically for the treatment of various conditions including viral infections (such as hepatitis B and C), certain cancers, and multiple sclerosis. Formulations with ocular use (ATC S01AD05) are indicated for certain eye diseases, but as of now, they are not widely used or approved for routine ophthalmic practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for interferon in an ophthalmic (ocular) application; limited or no published peer-reviewed clinical PK data available for ATC code S01AD05.
