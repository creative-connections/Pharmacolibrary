Combination products with naphazoline commonly include other agents such as antazoline or pheniramine for enhanced decongestant and antihistaminic effects. Naphazoline is approved for OTC use in many countries as an ocular or nasal decongestant, typically in combination with other ingredients.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters for naphazoline combinations with ATC S01GA51 (ocular administration) in humans could be identified.
