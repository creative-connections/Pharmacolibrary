    info ="<html><body><p>Ranibizumab is a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) that binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It is primarily used for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, and myopic choroidal neovascularization. Ranibizumab is an approved medication and is widely used in ophthalmology.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Reported pharmacokinetic parameters in adult patients with neovascular AMD after intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2016.11.011'>10.1016/j.phrs.2016.11.011</a> Serum pharmacokinetic parameters of ranibizumab following intravitreal injection were reported in studies including Herv√°s et al., Pharmacological Research 2017; values correspond to mean adult parameters after 0.5 mg dose. Bioavailability after ocular administration is estimated based on animal and limited human data; actual systemic exposure is low due to local administration.</li></ol></body></html>",
