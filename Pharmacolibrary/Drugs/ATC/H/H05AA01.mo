Historically, it was used as a replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism prior to the availability of purified parathyroid hormone (PTH) and recombinant PTH analogues. Due to safety, efficacy, and standardization concerns, as well as immunogenicity and advent of recombinant products, it is no longer widely approved or clinically used today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies directly report on parathyroid gland extract in humans.
