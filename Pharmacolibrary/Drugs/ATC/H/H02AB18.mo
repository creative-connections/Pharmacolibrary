It is being developed primarily for use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and other inflammatory disorders. As of 2024, vamorolone has received approval for DMD in several countries and remains under investigation for additional indications.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetics in healthy adult volunteers following single oral dosing; population PK modeling.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Mavroudis, PD, et al., &amp; Jusko, WJ (2019).
