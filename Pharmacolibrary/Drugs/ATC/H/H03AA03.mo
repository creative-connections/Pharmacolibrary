Historically used more frequently, such combinations are not the standard of care today in most countries, but are still prescribed in selected cases of thyroid hormone resistance or patient preference.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for a typical adult under oral administration. No population-specific published PK data available for the combination, values adapted from monotherapy studies.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No direct clinical pharmacokinetic studies of levothyroxine + liothyronine combinations reporting comprehensive PK parameters were found. Values are estimated from monotherapy references: T4 ka ~0.03 1/min, bioavailability 0.65; Vd ~10 L; clearance 0.25â€“0.6 L/h (midpoint used). Doses and ratios can vary widely. All PK values here are best estimates; corroborate with primary data if available.</li></ol></body></html>",
