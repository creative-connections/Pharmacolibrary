Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4), while iodine or its compounds provide a necessary substrate for endogenous hormone synthesis. This drug is mainly indicated where treatment with both hormone and iodine supplementation is appropriate, though such combinations are less commonly used today due to a preference for monotherapies. Levothyroxine alone is widely approved for hypothyroidism; the fixed combination is not universally used.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for fixed combinations of levothyroxine sodium and iodine compounds are not specifically reported in published literature. The following parameters are estimated based on pharmacokinetics of levothyroxine monotherapy in adults with hypothyroidism.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Thomas, MC, et al., &amp; Russ, GR (2002).
