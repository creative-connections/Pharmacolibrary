    info ="<html><body><p>Methyldopa (levorotatory) is an antihypertensive agent in the centrally acting antiadrenergic class, often used in combination with diuretics for the management of moderate to severe hypertension. It acts as a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, reducing peripheral vascular resistance. This combination was commonly used in the past, particularly in pregnancy-induced hypertension, but methyldopa is less frequently a first-line agent today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for methyldopa (levorotatory) co-administered with diuretics in adult patients, as direct published PK data for this specific combination is not available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> There are no published pharmacokinetic studies directly reporting methyldopa (levorotatory) and diuretics (ATC C02LB01) combination data. Pharmacokinetics are estimated from single-agent methyldopa literature and standard PK references, assuming no major alterations due to diuretics in the absence of primary data. Key references on methyldopa PK in monotherapy: PMID 7136717, Goodman & Gilmanâ€™s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (13th ed.). Data is approximate.</li></ol></body></html>",
