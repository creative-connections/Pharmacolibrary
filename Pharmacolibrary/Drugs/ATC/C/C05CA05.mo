It has been used for its vasoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-edematous properties. While widely used in some countries, it is not approved by the FDA in the United States.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies or clinical PK parameters for hidrosmin were found as of June 2024; therefore, the following pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated/extrapolated based on similar flavonoid drugs (such as diosmin or hesperidin) in healthy adult volunteers.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
