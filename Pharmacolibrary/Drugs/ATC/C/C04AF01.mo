    </table><p>Kallidinogenase is an enzyme derived from animal pancreas, used primarily in certain Asian countries to treat peripheral vascular diseases and cerebrovascular disorders by facilitating vasodilation through the kininâ€“kallikrein system. It is not widely approved or used in the United States or Europe for these indications.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for kallidinogenase in humans have not been reported in peer-reviewed publications. The following are estimated parameters based on general enzyme characteristics and dose regimens reported in clinical and therapeutic product information.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
