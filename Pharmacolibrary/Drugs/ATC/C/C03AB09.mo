Cyclothiazide is a thiazide diuretic, while potassium is included to counter thiazide-induced hypokalemia. This combination was previously used, but is rarely prescribed today due to the availability of newer agents.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data available specific for the cyclothiazide and potassium combination product in humans.
