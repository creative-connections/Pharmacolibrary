The combination (ATC C03EA12) is approved and indicated for the management of hypertension and for edema associated with heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, or renal disease.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models are available for the fixed combination. The following parameters are estimated based on pharmacokinetics of metolazone and potassium-sparing agents administered orally in adult patients with hypertension.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
