It works by increasing cardiac contractility without increasing intracellular calcium concentrations or myocardial oxygen consumption. It has been assessed in clinical trials for chronic heart failure, but is not widely approved for routine use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult subjects after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bcp.13778'>10.1111/bcp.13778</a> Values were extracted from a published population pharmacokinetic analysis (Trifir√≤ et al., British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, 2019) which reported a two-compartment model in healthy subjects.
