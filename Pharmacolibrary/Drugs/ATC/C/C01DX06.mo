It acts primarily as an adenosine reuptake inhibitor, increasing adenosine's vasodilatory effects. Hexobendine is not widely used today and is considered obsolete in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic studies in humans are available in the literature as of June 2024. The following pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated for an adult based on general properties of similar vasodilators with moderate oral bioavailability.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Hansing, CE, et al., &amp; Rowe, GG (1972).
