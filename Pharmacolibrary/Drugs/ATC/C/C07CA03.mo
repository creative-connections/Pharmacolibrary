    info ="<html><body><p>This fixed-dose combination drug contains pindolol, a non-selective beta blocker, and a diuretic agent. Pindolol is used primarily to treat hypertension and angina pectoris. The combination with a diuretic allows for enhanced antihypertensive efficacy. This combination (ATC: C07CA03) has been previously marketed, but fixed combinations of pindolol and diuretics are not commonly used or approved in most contemporary formularies.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific pharmacokinetic studies were identified for the combination of pindolol and diuretics (C07CA03). Parameter estimates are provided based on separate literature for pindolol and typical thiazide diuretics in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
