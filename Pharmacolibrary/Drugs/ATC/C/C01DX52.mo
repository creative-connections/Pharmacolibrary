It acts primarily by reducing myocardial oxygen demand. Prenylamine is no longer widely used or approved in most countries due to safety concerns, such as risk of ventricular arrhythmias.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic (PK) data specifically available for prenylamine combinations (C01DX52) in humans. Parameters estimated based on typical profiles for oral calcium channel blockers. Model assumes parameters for a healthy adult population.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
