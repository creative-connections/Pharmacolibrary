While it has been historically used for cardiovascular risk reduction, its use has declined due to side effects and the advent of more effective therapies. It is still approved in some countries as an adjunct in lipid disorders.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported in healthy adult volunteers after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
