It enhances cardiac contractility, vasodilation, and renal perfusion. Its clinical use has decreased in recent years due to limited efficacy data and adverse effects; it is not widely approved or in common use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters based on studies in adult healthy volunteers and critically ill patients.
