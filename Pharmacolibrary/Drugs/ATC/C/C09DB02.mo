    info ="<html><body><p>Olmesartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) and amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Co-formulated as a fixed-dose combination, this medication is used for treating hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults and children over 6 years. It is approved for current clinical use in many countries to help lower risk of cardiovascular events by controlling blood pressure.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult volunteers after oral administration of the combination tablet.

Two-compartment model parameters are for olmesartan; amlodipine PK is described as extensively distributed (Vd â‰ˆ 21 L/kg; not fixed in this model) and more slowly cleared. Where values for the fixed-dose combination are unavailable, olmesartan values are used as they dominate the PK profile. Doses are the typical lowest strength combination (20 mg olmesartan/5 mg amlodipine); other strengths exist.</li></ol></body></html>",
