It has been used historically as a plasma volume expander and as a source of carbohydrate calories in parenteral nutrition, particularly when glucose administration is undesirable (e.g., hereditary fructose intolerance). It is not a commonly approved drug for clinical use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters for invert sugar (ATC code C05BB03) could be found in published literature for administration as a medicinal product in humans.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Roemer, E, Schorp, MK, Piadé, JJ, Seeman, JI, Leyden, DE, &amp; Haussmann, HJ (2012).
