Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) that lowers cholesterol, while amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure and angina. This combination is approved for use in various countries to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients who require both lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapy.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for fixed-dose combination of atorvastatin and amlodipine in healthy adult subjects, as no published population PK modeling of the combination formulation was found.
