    </table><p>Meldonium (also known as mildronate) is a synthetic compound that inhibits carnitine biosynthesis. It was originally developed in Latvia and has been used as a metabolic modulator to treat ischemic heart disease, angina, and myocardial infarction, as well as for enhancing exercise tolerance. It is not FDA-approved in the United States, but has been used clinically in some post-Soviet states. Meldonium became widely known after being banned by WADA for use in athletes from 2016.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Healthy adult volunteers, both sexes, single oral dose.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Knych, HK, et al., &amp; Kass, PH (2017).
