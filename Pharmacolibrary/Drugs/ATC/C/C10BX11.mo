The combination is indicated for cardiovascular risk reduction, especially in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. It is approved and marketed in various countries under combination product names.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published population pharmacokinetic model for the fixed-dose combination of atorvastatin, amlodipine and perindopril is available.
