    info ="<html><body><p>Bucladesine (dibutyryl cyclic AMP) is a synthetic analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) that acts as a phosphodiesterase-resistant cAMP derivative. It was investigated for its use as a vasodilator and in the treatment of heart failure and peripheral vascular diseases. It is not currently approved or in clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No human pharmacokinetic parameter data are reported in the literature for bucladesine. The following represents an estimated one-compartment PK model for intravenous administration, reflecting typical parameters for small, hydrophilic nucleoside analogs. These figures are likely to be rough estimates and not derived from primary data.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>H van den Bosch,Intracellular phospholipases A.,Biochimica et biophysica acta,1980<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6252969/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6252969/</a></li><li>K Nakagawa, F N Miller, A W Knott, M J Edwards,Pentoxifylline inhibits FMLP-induced macromolecular leakage.,The American journal of physiology,1995<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7631853/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7631853/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
