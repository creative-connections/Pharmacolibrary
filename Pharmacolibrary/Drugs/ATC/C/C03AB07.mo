Combination with potassium is intended to address potassium loss during diuretic treatment. Cyclopenthiazide is not widely marketed anymore and has largely been replaced by other thiazides but was previously approved for clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published studies were found providing explicit pharmacokinetic parameters for the fixed combination of cyclopenthiazide and potassium. The following values are estimated based on the general pharmacokinetic properties of thiazide diuretics in healthy adults after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>I MacGillivray, D M Campbell,The relevance of hypertension and oedema in pregnancy.,Clinical and experimental hypertension,1980<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7428567/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7428567/</a></li><li>L Kersten, H Br√§unlich,Influence of diuretics on renal lithium excretion and tissue distribution of some cations in saline loaded young and adult rats.,Biomedica biochimica acta,1987<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3632646/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3632646/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
