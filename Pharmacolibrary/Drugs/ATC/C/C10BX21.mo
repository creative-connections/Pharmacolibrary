    info ="<html><body><p>Rosuvastatin and perindopril is a fixed combination antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication. Rosuvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) primarily used for lowering cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease. Perindopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used for treating high blood pressure and heart failure. The combination is approved for cardiovascular risk reduction in selected adult patients.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models reporting population PK parameters for the fixed combination of rosuvastatin and perindopril with ATC code C10BX21 in humans. Individual component PK parameters are established: rosuvastatin is well-absorbed orally (bioavailability ~0.20), with a Tlag around 10 min, one-compartment model, central Vd 50 L, oral clearance approx 20 L/h; perindopril is well-absorbed, rapidly converted to active perindoprilat (bioavailability ~0.65), central Vd approx 75 L, clearance ~17 L/h. Estimates below based on published individual drug PK studies in adults after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
