It is often co-formulated with potassium to counteract thiazide-induced hypokalemia. This combination was approved and marketed in some regions historically for hypertension, but its use today is limited, and it is not widely available.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for polythiazide in adult healthy individuals.
