It acts by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules, leading to increased excretion of sodium and water. Methyclothiazide was formerly widely used, but is less common today and not widely available in many regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated mean pharmacokinetic parameters for a typical adult population, as no published human PK model studies with detailed compartmental analysis or explicit values could be identified.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No original clinical pharmacokinetic model or published PK study with full compartmental parameters found for methyclothiazide; values estimated based on limited secondary literature descriptions, thiazide class effects, and US prescribing information (e.g., elimination half-life reported 10â€“12 hours, high oral absorption).
