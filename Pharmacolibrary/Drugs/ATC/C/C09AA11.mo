It is usually administered as its prodrug spirapril, which is hydrolyzed in vivo to the active metabolite spiraprilat. While it was previously marketed and used clinically, spirapril has been withdrawn from several markets and is not widely used today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are reported for healthy adult volunteers following oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Ding, PY, et al., &amp; Liao, W (2000).
