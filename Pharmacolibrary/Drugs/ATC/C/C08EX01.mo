It is not currently approved or used in clinical practice in most countries due to concerns about side effects and limited therapeutic benefit.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published, peer-reviewed human pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of lidoflazine reporting compartmental PK parameters could be identified as of 2024.
