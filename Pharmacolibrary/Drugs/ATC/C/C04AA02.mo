It is a β-adrenergic agonist and its clinical use has declined significantly, and it is no longer widely approved or used.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic data is available in the scientific literature for buphenine as of June 2024. The following parameters are estimates based on general properties of orally administered β-agonists and values of similar drugs.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Hashem, A, &amp; Lubczyk, B (1991).
