While it has been historically used for cardiovascular risk reduction, its use has declined due to side effects and the advent of more effective therapies. It is still approved in some countries as an adjunct in lipid disorders.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported after intravenous administration in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01991741'>10.1007/BF01991741</a> Pharmacokinetics after IV administration in published healthy subject study; numbers for Vd and clearance per kg and per minute.</li></ol></body></html>",
