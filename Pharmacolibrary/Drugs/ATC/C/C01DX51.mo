The 'combinations' category refers to its historical use in combination with other agents. The drug is not currently widely approved or used in modern clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies are available for itramin tosilate, combinations (ATC C01DX51) in humans. The following PK parameters are rough estimates based on the class of cardiac vasodilators (aromatic amines) and dosing practices from older literature. Typical estimates are provided for an intravenous bolus administered to healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
