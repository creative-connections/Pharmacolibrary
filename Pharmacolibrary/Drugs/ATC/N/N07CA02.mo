It acts as a selective calcium channel blocker and histamine H1 receptor antagonist. Although widely used in many countries, cinnarizine is not approved for use in the United States or some other regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Reported pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy adult volunteers after a single oral dose administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2125.1987.tb03091.x'>10.1111/j.1365-2125.1987.tb03091.x</a> The reported values are based on a published population pharmacokinetic study of cinnarizine in healthy adult volunteers.
