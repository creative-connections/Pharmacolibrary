No primary pharmacokinetic publications could be identified for N03AD51 combinations; therefore, standard single-agent ethosuximide PK data and reasonable estimates are provided.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No specific pharmacokinetic studies are available for ethosuximide, combinations (ATC N03AD51). The provided figures are estimated based on studies for ethosuximide as a single agent and adjusted for typical oral use in adults.
