    info       = "<html><body><table><tr><td>Drug:</td><td>N05BA22</td></tr><td>route:</td><td>oral</td></tr><tr><td>n-compartments</td><td>2</td></tr></table><p>Cloxazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative used as an anxiolytic and for the treatment of anxiety disorders. It has sedative and muscle-relaxant properties. The drug is no longer widely used in most countries and is not currently FDA-approved in the United States, but is still marketed in Japan and a few other countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated based on class similarity to other oral benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) given the absence of direct published PK studies for cloxazolam in the literature. Assumed for a typical healthy adult population, single oral dose.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Lavene, D, et al., &amp; Rulliere, R (1980).
