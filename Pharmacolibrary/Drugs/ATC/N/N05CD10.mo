It acts mainly on the GABA-A receptor to produce sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects. Quazepam is currently approved for medical use in some countries; its use has declined in favor of other hypnotics due to concerns over dependence and side effects.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetics based on healthy adult male volunteers after single oral dose.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Fukasawa, T, et al., &amp; Otani, K (2004).
