    info ="<html><body><p>Hydrocodone and ibuprofen is a combination drug used to treat moderate to severe pain where treatment with an opioid is appropriate and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Hydrocodone is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic, and ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The fixed combination is approved for short-term management of acute pain in adults. Hydrocodone acts as a mu-opioid receptor agonist, and ibuprofen acts by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis via non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetics after single oral administration of a fixed-dose combination (hydrocodone 7.5 mg/ibuprofen 200 mg) in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>James C Thigpen, Brian L Odle, Sam Harirforoosh,Opioids: A Review of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Neonates, Infants, and Children.,European journal of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,2019<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31006834/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31006834/</a></li><li>Krishna Devarakonda, Kenneth Kostenbader, Michael J Giuliani, Jim L Young,Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of biphasic immediate-release/extended-release hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen (MNK-155) compared with immediate-release hydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen and immediate-release tramadol HCl/acetaminophen.,Journal of pain research,2015<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26508885/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26508885/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
