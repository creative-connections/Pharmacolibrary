It was previously used in some countries for the short-term treatment of anxiety disorders and related conditions, but is not widely approved or marketed today due to limited safety and efficacy data.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on structural similarity to diazepam and available benzodiazepine data. No primary literature sources reporting PK for fludiazepam in humans were identified. Estimates below are for a healthy adult following oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
