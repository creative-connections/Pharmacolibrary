Due to its association with renal toxicity and carcinogenicity, bucetin has been withdrawn from human use and is not approved today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic models or parameter values specific for bucetin combinations (excluding psycholeptics) were found in the literature as of 2024. The following are estimated expected parameters for a typical oral dose in adults, based on analogy with phenacetin and other related aniline analgesics.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
