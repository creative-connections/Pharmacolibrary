Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic, while acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. This fixed-dose combination is used to provide synergistic pain relief. Combination preparations of oxycodone and acetylsalicylic acid have been available in some countries but are not widely used or approved today due to the availability of safer alternatives and regulatory concerns around opioid use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult subjects, based on the separate pharmacokinetics of oxycodone and acetylsalicylic acid administered orally as a fixed-dose combination.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Murphy, EJ (2005).
