    info ="<html><body><p>Levomethadone is the levorotatory (R)-enantiomer of methadone and acts as a full opioid agonist, primarily at the mu-opioid receptor. It is used in opioid substitution therapy, particularly in the management of opioid dependence, and sometimes for chronic pain. Its use is approved in several European countries, but not in the US where racemic methadone is more commonly used.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for a typical adult population, based primarily on known PK parameters for racemic methadone with consideration of the higher activity and potentially different kinetics of the (R)-enantiomer. No specific, publication-referenced PK data available for levomethadone.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Nicole Studer, Sabina Diez Bernal, Wolfgang Thormann, Olivier Levionnois, Claudia Spadavecchia,Antinociceptive effects of levomethadone in standing horses sedated with romifidine.,Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia,2021<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33685821/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33685821/</a></li><li>Jörn Lötsch, Carsten Skarke, Johannes Wieting, Bruno Georg Oertel, Helmut Schmidt, Jürgen Brockmöller, Gerd Geisslinger,Modulation of the central nervous effects of levomethadone by genetic polymorphisms potentially affecting its metabolism, distribution, and drug action.,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2006<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16413243/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16413243/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
