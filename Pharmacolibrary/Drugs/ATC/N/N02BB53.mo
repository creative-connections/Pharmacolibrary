It is generally found as a component in combination painkiller preparations, excluding those with psycholeptic agents. Due to safety concerns, particularly agranulocytosis, it is not approved or used widely today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated single-dose pharmacokinetics in adults (general population), for a typical oral tablet combination excluding psycholeptics.
