    info ="<html><body><p>Nalbuphine is a synthetic opioid analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain. It acts as a mixed agonist-antagonist at opioid receptorsâ€”agonist at kappa-opioid receptors and antagonist at mu-opioid receptors. It is primarily approved for use in the management and relief of pain, pre- and postoperative analgesia, and as a supplement to balanced anesthesia. It is currently approved for medical use in several countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported in healthy adult volunteers after intravenous administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00541959'>10.1007/BF00541959</a> Parameters from: Gegg JE, Winek CL, Tolman EL, McFarland VG.
