The purpose of such combinations is historically aimed at treating pain states accompanied by agitation or anxiety. However, these combinations are not widely approved or used in modern clinical practice due to safety and efficacy concerns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for adult population, oral administration; no published PK data available specifically for the acetylsalicylic acid-psycholeptic combination; values are estimated based on acetylsalicylic acid monotherapy PK in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
