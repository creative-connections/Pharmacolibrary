It acts as a central nervous system depressant. Methylpentynol is no longer widely used today due to the availability of safer alternatives and concerns about its safety profile.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic studies reporting parameter values for methylpentynol were found.
