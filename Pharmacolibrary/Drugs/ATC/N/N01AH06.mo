    info ="<html><body><p>Remifentanil is an ultra-short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic approved for use as an adjunct to anesthesia during surgery or for sedation in intensive care settings. It is administered intravenously due to its rapid hydrolysis by nonspecific blood and tissue esterases, which gives it a very short context-sensitive half-life. Remifentanil is widely used in clinical practice today for its predictable, rapid onset and offset.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy adult volunteers administered intravenous remifentanil (aged 19â€“53 years, both sexes).</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00000542-199612000-00009'>10.1097/00000542-199612000-00009</a> PK parameters extracted from: Egan TD et al., Anesthesiology. 1996 Dec;85(6):1283-94.
