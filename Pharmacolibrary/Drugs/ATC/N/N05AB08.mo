Its use has largely declined in many countries due to the advent of atypical antipsychotics, but it may still be available or in use in some regions for severe agitation, psychosis, or nausea/vomiting.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic studies with reported model-based PK parameters were found for thioproperazine.
