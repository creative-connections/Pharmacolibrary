It is still approved and widely used in dental procedures, emergency care for pain management, and as an adjunct to other anesthetics in surgical settings.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetics in healthy adult individuals based on physicochemical properties and references to similar inhaled anesthetic gases. Because nitrous oxide is administered by inhalation and is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, classical oral PK parameters such as ka and Tlag are not relevant. Most of the uptake and elimination occurs in the lungs via pulmonary exchange.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Fiorillo, L (2019).
