It is a tertiary alcohol derivative, has central nervous system depressant properties, and was historically used in combination products. Due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives, methylpentynol is no longer approved or widely used in modern clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies are available in the literature for methylpentynol or its combinations.
