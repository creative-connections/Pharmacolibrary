Ketobemidone acts as a mu-opioid receptor agonist with analgesic effects, while antispasmodics help reduce smooth muscle spasms. This combination is not widely used or approved today in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters are available for the combination 'ketobemidone and antispasmodics' (N02AG02) in the literature; parameters below are estimated based on data from ketobemidone alone in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
