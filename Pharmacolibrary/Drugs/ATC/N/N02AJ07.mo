Codeine is an opioid analgesic providing pain relief and cough suppression, while acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The combination has been widely used in clinical practice and is generally approved and available for pain management in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters based on typical oral doses in healthy adult population; no specific publication reporting combination PK was identified. Estimates are based on literature of individual components (codeine and acetylsalicylic acid) administered orally.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
