It was historically used in Europe for the treatment of schizophrenia, psychosis, and agitation, as well as a component of injectable veterinary sedatives (notably fluanisone/fentanyl combinations for small animals). It is not currently widely used or approved for use in humans today due to newer antipsychotics with improved safety profiles.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters based on limited data and analogy to other butyrophenone antipsychotics (such as haloperidol), for adult human subjects; no direct PK human studies are published.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>M Gumbleton, P J Nicholls, G Taylor,Differential effects of anesthetic regimens on gentamicin pharmacokinetics in the rat: a comparison with chronically catheterized conscious animals.,Pharmaceutical research,1990<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2300534/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2300534/</a></li><li>M Gumbleton, P J Nicholls, G Taylor,Differential influence of laboratory anaesthetic regimens upon renal and hepatosplanchnic haemodynamics in the rat.,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,1990<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1982140/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1982140/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
