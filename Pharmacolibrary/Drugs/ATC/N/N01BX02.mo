    info ="<html><body><p>Dyclonine is a topical local anesthetic used to relieve pain and irritation in the mouth and throat. It is commonly found in over-the-counter throat lozenges and sprays for the temporary relief of minor mouth and throat discomfort. Dyclonine is not widely used as a prescription medication and is not among the first-choice local anesthetics in medical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies in humans were found for dyclonine. The following pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on the known properties of similar local anesthetics and typical administration routes.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Chang, Y, et al., &amp; Wang, G (2024).
