Today, it is rarely used or approved due to its side effect profile and the availability of safer alternatives. In some markets, it was available in combination with other agents for specific indications.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters for emepronium, combinations, were found in scientific literature or public pharmacokinetic databases as of current knowledge (up to 2024).
