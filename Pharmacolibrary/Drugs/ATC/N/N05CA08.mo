It is a short-acting barbiturate related to pentobarbital and was primarily prescribed for the treatment of insomnia and as a premedication before anesthesia. Its use has been discontinued or is extremely limited in modern clinical practice due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for a typical adult following oral administration.
