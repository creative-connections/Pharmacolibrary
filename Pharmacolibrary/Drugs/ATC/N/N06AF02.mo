Due to serious adverse effects including hepatotoxicity, its clinical use has been discontinued and it is no longer approved or in use in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No dedicated pharmacokinetic publications or clinical PK model references for nialamide identified in available scientific literature. Below is an estimated one-compartment model for a typical adult, based on physicochemical characteristics, historical case reports, and class analogs (other hydrazine MAOIs). Parameters are to be interpreted cautiously as rough estimates.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
