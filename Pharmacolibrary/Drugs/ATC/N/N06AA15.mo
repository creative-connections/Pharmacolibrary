It was used primarily in the 1960s and 1970s for the treatment of depression but is no longer marketed or approved for use in most countries due to a lack of efficacy data and the availability of safer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published primary pharmacokinetic studies in humans found. The following parameters are estimated based on pharmacological similarity to other tricyclic antidepressants, specifically amitriptyline, which has a related structure and clinical use profile. Estimates are for healthy adult subjects, oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>J Bourgouin, M A Gagnon, R Elie, D Dvornik, R Gonzalez, M Kraml,Butriptyline: human pharmacokinetics and comparative bioavailability of conventional and sustained release formulations.,Biopharmaceutics & drug disposition,1981<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6894708/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6894708/</a></li><li>J Amsterdam, D Brunswick, J Mendels,The clinical application of tricyclic antidepressant pharmacokinetics and plasma levels.,The American journal of psychiatry,1980<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6990798/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6990798/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
