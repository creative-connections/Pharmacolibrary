    info ="<html><body><p>Melitracen is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) of the dibenzazepine class used primarily for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. It is structurally related to amitriptyline and other classic TCAs. Melitracen is not widely approved in many countries but is still marketed in some regions, often in combination with flupentixol for depression and anxiety.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published studies were found reporting detailed pharmacokinetic parameters (such as volume of distribution or clearance) for melitracen in humans. The following values are pharmacologically estimated based on available information for similar tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Lihua Wu, Chang Xu, Guolan Wu, Huili Zhou, Duo Lv, You Zhai, Yujie Huang, Wenling Tang, Fangqiong Li, Jianzhong Shentu,Bioequivalence Study Of A Fixed-Dose Combination Tablet Containing Melitracen 10 mg And Flupentixol 0.5 mg In Healthy Chinese Volunteers Under Fasted And Fed Conditions.,Drug design, development and therapy,2019<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31571834/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31571834/</a></li><li>Jinjing Che, Qingfang Meng, Zhihang Chen, Chengqi San, Yunan Hou, Yuanguo Cheng,Validation of a sensitive LC/MS/MS method for simultaneous quantitation of flupentixol and melitracene in human plasma.,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2007<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17881181/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17881181/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
