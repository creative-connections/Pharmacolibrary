It was developed for neuroprotective use, particularly in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, it is not approved or in use today, as clinical trials failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for tirilazad in adult patients, based on published summary data from clinical trials and public reviews. Likely based on intravenous administration in the context of neuroprotection in acute injury patients.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Fleishaker, JC, et al., &amp; Grasela, TH (1999).
