Its use is mainly based on historical and ethnopharmacological evidence and it is available in over-the-counter and traditional remedies rather than as an approved modern pharmaceutical. Cimicifugae rhizoma is not recognized as an approved drug by major regulatory agencies like FDA or EMA.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No clinical pharmacokinetic studies reporting model parameters for Cimicifugae rhizoma as a whole extract were found in the indexed literature. No population, sex, or disease-specific models available. The following estimates are based on general assumptions for herbal oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Hu, L, et al., &amp; Yao, X (2019).
