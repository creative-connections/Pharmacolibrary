It is considered a drug of choice for life-threatening mycoses, including cryptococcal meningitis and invasive candidiasis. Despite its effectiveness, it is associated with significant nephrotoxicity and infusion-related reactions. Conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate is still in use, while lipid formulations are also approved to reduce toxicity.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters in adult patients with systemic fungal infections, administered intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate (non-lipid formulation).</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jac/14.suppl_a.125'>10.1093/jac/14.suppl_a.125</a> Data extracted from commonly cited review and original research articles in adult populations; values represent standard ranges and middle of estimated values in cited literature.
