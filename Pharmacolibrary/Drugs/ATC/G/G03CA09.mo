    info ="<html><body><p>Promestriene is a synthetic derivative of estradiol (an estrogen), primarily used as a topical treatment in gynecology for symptoms of vaginal atrophy, such as dryness, irritation, and itching. It is not considered a systemic estrogen and is mostly used in local therapy (e.g., vaginal creams or ovules). As of 2024, pro-mestriene is not approved for use in the United States but has been available in some European, Latin American, and Asian markets.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed publications with specific pharmacokinetic parameters of pro-mestriene in humans were found. Due to its almost exclusively topical (vaginal) administration and negligible systemic absorption, systemic pharmacokinetic parameters are generally unreported and are likely clinically irrelevant.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Borrelli, AL, et al., &amp; Berlingieri, D (1990).
