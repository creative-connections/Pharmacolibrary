    info ="<html><body><p>Finasteride and tadalafil is a fixed-dose combination medication used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in adult men. Finasteride is a 5Î±-reductase inhibitor that reduces prostatic volume by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, while tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor primarily used in erectile dysfunction and BPH to relax smooth muscle in the lower urinary tract. The combination is approved and marketed in several countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy adult males, since no published population pharmacokinetic model for the fixed-dose combination is available; separate parameters for finasteride and tadalafil monotherapy are known, estimates are provided for the combination.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
