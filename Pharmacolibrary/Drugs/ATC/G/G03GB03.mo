    </table><p>Epimestrol is a synthetic steroidal estrogen used primarily as part of ovulation induction protocols for the treatment of female infertility. It is an estrogen prodrug, primarily converted to 17-epiestradiol in the body. Epimestrol is no longer widely marketed or approved in many countries, and its use has been largely superseded by newer ovulation induction agents.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data for epimestrol in humans is available in the scientific literature as of 2024. All pharmacokinetic parameters estimated based on the closely related estrogen compounds.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
