It has historically been used topically to treat infections such as candidiasis and as a bactericidal agent. Methylrosaniline is not widely approved or used in modern clinical practice due to concerns of toxicity and the availability of safer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed studies reporting detailed human pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for methylrosaniline were found in the literature. The following parameters are estimated based on general properties of similar triphenylmethane dyes and topical application.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
