Chlormadinone is a progestogen, while the estrogen component is typically ethinyl estradiol. This combination is not widely used or approved in contemporary clinical practice in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters found for the fixed-dose combination of chlormadinone and estrogen as a combined preparation. Estimates below are based on available chlormadinone acetate oral PK data in healthy adult females.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No published PK studies report pharmacokinetic parameters for the fixed combination product (G03FB03). The parameters are estimated from published values for oral chlormadinone acetate alone in healthy female adults (e.g., Gr√§ser T et al, Arzneimittelforschung. 2007 Jul;57(7):504-10), and for ethinylestradiol (from general literature). The values here are single compartment model approximations and not based on specific clinical studies for the combination product.</li></ol></body></html>",
