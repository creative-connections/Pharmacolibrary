It is not absorbed systemically in clinically relevant amounts and is not approved for use in the United States and many countries but is used in several European, Asian, and Latin American countries. It is used as a local agent for the treatment of infected mucous membranes and wounds.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published clinical pharmacokinetic studies or parameter data for policresulen in humans; it is generally considered to act locally with negligible systemic absorption.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
