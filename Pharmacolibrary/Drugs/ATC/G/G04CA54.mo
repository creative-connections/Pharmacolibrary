    info ="<html><body><p>Tamsulosin and tadalafil is a fixed-dose combination used primarily in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in adult men, with tamsulosin acting as an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist and tadalafil as a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. The combination is approved and used today for such indications in some countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models providing compartmental parameters for the tamsulosin and tadalafil fixed-dose combination exist as of June 2024. Therefore, estimated parameters are based on known pharmacokinetics of individual oral tamsulosin and tadalafil in healthy adult males.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
