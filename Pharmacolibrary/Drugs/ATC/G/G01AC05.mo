It is commonly found in lozenges or topical formulations for oral, vaginal, and skin infections due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria and Candida species. Dequalinium is approved in some countries for topical use, such as treatment of vaginal infections.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies in humans identified; parameters are estimated based on physicochemical properties and clinical use.
