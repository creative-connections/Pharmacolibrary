Its use as a systemic agent has greatly declined due to safety concerns, but it may still be found in some topical formulations.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No robust or specific population pharmacokinetic parameters for clioquinol could be found in the primary literature for any population or condition. The following are estimated parameters based on limited historical data, approximate values, and general knowledge of related hydroxyquinolines.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Schimmer, AD, et al., &amp; Minden, MD (2012).
