    </table><p>Terconazole is a triazole antifungal agent primarily used for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. It is administered as a topical formulation and is FDA-approved for intravaginal use. Its mechanism of action is through inhibition of fungal cytochrome P450 14Î±-demethylase, impairing ergosterol synthesis and thus fungal cell membrane formation.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for adult female subjects using intravaginal administration; values are approximated based on summary statements available from product labels and secondary literature, as no detailed compartmental PK modeling for terconazole in humans is published.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
