It is primarily administered by inhalation to relieve bronchospasm. Fenoterol was widely used in the past; however, due to concerns over increased risk of severe asthma exacerbations, its inhaled formulations have been withdrawn or restricted in many countries and it is less commonly used today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are reported for healthy adult volunteers after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
