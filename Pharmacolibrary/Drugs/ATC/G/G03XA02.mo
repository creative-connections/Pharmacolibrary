    info ="<html><body><p>Gestrinone is a synthetic steroid with antiprogestogenic, antiestrogenic, and weak androgenic properties. It has been used chiefly in the management of endometriosis. It is not currently approved for use in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from available secondary reviews and summary data, mainly in adult women treated for endometriosis, as specific detailed human pharmacokinetic data for gestrinone are sparse.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No original clinical PK studies with detailed compartmental modeling for gestrinone were found; parameters are estimated from sparse literature reviews, summary pharmacokinetic evaluation, and analogy with similar compounds (e.g., ethinylestradiol, danazol). Oral bioavailability estimated to be 16.5%, tmax approximately 1â€“3 hours, with high Vd due to lipophilicity. Clearance and other values estimated due to lack of direct reports.</li></ol></body></html>",
