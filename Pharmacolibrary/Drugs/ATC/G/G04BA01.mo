It is also used to increase urinary acidity for certain medical conditions. Its routine use as a medication is not common in modern clinical practice, and it is not widely approved for therapeutic use globally today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult humans, as published PK models or direct clinical pharmacokinetic data for ammonium chloride are not available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Liu, R, et al., &amp; Lee, EJ (2011).
