It is also used as an electrolyte replenisher and is available as an over-the-counter oral preparation. The drug is generally considered safe and is approved for use in many countries today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No formal pharmacokinetic studies with compartment model parameters found in the published scientific literature for magnesium gluconate in humans. The following values are rough estimates extrapolated from general knowledge of oral magnesium salts' pharmacokinetics in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>A Sparsa, J-M Bonnetblanc,[Lithium].,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,2004<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15107743/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15107743/</a></li><li>M Siepmann, S Spank, A Kluge, A Schappach, W Kirch,The pharmacokinetics of zinc from zinc gluconate: a comparison with zinc oxide in healthy men.,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2005<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16372518/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16372518/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
