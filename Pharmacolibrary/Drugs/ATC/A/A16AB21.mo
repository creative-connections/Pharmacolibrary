    info ="<html><body><p>Atidarsagene autotemcel is an autologous, genetically modified CD34+ cell therapy indicated for the treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). It delivers a functional ARSA gene to correct the underlying enzymatic deficiency. It is approved for use in certain countries for pre-symptomatic or early-symptomatic pediatric patients with MLD.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published, peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic (PK) model parameters have been identified for atidarsagene autotemcel in any population. As a cell-based gene therapy, standard small molecule PK parameters such as clearance or volume of distribution are not readily applicable. Pharmacokinetic evaluation is generally replaced by engraftment and gene expression studies.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
