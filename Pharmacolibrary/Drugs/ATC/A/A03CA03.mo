The fixed combination (ATC: A03CA03) was used to manage gastrointestinal disorders with psychological or neurovegetative symptoms. This combination is no longer widely approved or in clinical use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies have been identified for the fixed combination of oxyphencyclimine and psycholeptics (A03CA03).
