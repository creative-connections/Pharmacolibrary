It is rarely used today due to better tolerated and safer alternatives. The drug is characterized by its poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which localizes its antimicrobial activity within the intestine.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adults, both sexes, after oral administration, based on poor systemic absorption characteristics of sulfonamides.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Yasuda, T, et al., &amp; Ohsawa, K (2004).
