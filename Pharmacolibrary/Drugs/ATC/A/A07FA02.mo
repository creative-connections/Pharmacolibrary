It is not a pharmacological drug but a living microorganism that acts by modulating the gut flora and local immunity. It is approved and widely used as an over-the-counter probiotic supplement in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No classical pharmacokinetic parameters are reported because Saccharomyces boulardii is a living microorganism, not absorbed systemically, and exerts its effects locally in the gastrointestinal tract in both adult and pediatric populations.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
