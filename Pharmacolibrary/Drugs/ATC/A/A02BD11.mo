It contains pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitor), amoxicillin (penicillin-antibiotic), clarithromycin (macrolide-antibiotic), and metronidazole (nitroimidazole-antibiotic). These are combined to suppress gastric acid and provide broad-spectrum antibacterial action. The combination is used as first-line therapy in several clinical guidelines.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No experimental pharmacokinetic (PK) model for the fixed four-drug combination was identified; parameters herein are estimated based on representative oral PK profiles from literature for each drug in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No direct PK models or primary data for this four-drug combination were identified. Above values are a rough estimate for healthy adult oral use, combining typical literature parameters for each constituent. If any drug is given in a different way or dosed differently, PK would vary. For detailed, component-specific PK modeling, refer to individual drugsâ€™ published data.</li></ol></body></html>",
