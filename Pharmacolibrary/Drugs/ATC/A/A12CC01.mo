It is also employed for electrolyte replacement in situations such as pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, cardiac arrhythmias, and certain metabolic disturbances. Magnesium salts in general have important roles in neuromuscular and cardiovascular function. Magnesium chloride is approved for medical use and is commonly administered intravenously or orally.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult individuals following intravenous administration, because no published detailed human PK modeling was identified.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>V V Ranade, J C Somberg,Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of magnesium after administration of magnesium salts to humans.,American journal of therapeutics,2001<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11550076/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11550076/</a></li><li>Arohan R Subramanya, David H Ellison,Distal convoluted tubule.,Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2014<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24855283/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24855283/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
