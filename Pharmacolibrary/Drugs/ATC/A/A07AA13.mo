Unlike rifampin, rifamycin (A07AA13) is administered orally as a non-absorbed antimicrobial agent and is approved for use in several countries for this indication.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Adult healthy volunteers, both sexes; single oral dose of rifamycin SV tablets</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> There are no published population pharmacokinetic models for orally administered rifamycin (A07AA13) in the literature as the drug is minimally absorbed; reported values are representative estimates based on available plasma data in healthy adults after single oral doses. Actual systemic exposure is extremely low (bioavailability ~1%), and PK is usually not modeled due to negligible absorption.</li></ol></body></html>",
