They act as antimuscarinic agents and historically have been used for their antispasmodic, antiemetic, and sedative (psycholeptic) effects, particularly in gastrointestinal disorders; combinations with psycholeptics (sedatives/tranquilizers) were primarily used in the past. Currently, such fixed combinations are rarely used and are not generally approved in modern clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated based on component alkaloids (primarily atropine and scopolamine) for typical oral administration and standard adult subjects; no direct clinical pharmacokinetic studies exist for the combined total alkaloids and psycholeptic fixed-combination product.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
