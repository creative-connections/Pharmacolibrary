It is designed to treat mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome), a lysosomal storage disorder, by facilitating IDS delivery across the blood-brain barrier. Pabinafusp alfa is approved in Japan for the treatment of MPS II.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for typical pediatric patients (children with MPS II) following intravenous infusion.
