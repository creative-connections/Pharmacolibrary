    info ="<html><body><p>Pioglitazone and alogliptin is a fixed-dose combination antidiabetic medication used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus when diet, exercise, and either agent alone do not provide adequate glycemic control. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that improves insulin sensitivity, while alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that increases levels of incretin hormones. The combination is approved for use in several countries including those in the EU and US.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult subjects based on separate published PK data for pioglitazone and alogliptin, as no population PK study of the fixed-dose combination exists.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> No population PK publication found specifically for the fixed-dose combination (A10BD09). Parameters represent estimated typical values derived from published individual drug PK studies: pioglitazone has high oral bioavailability and is hepatically cleared with Vd of ~0.25â€“0.63 L/kg; alogliptin is largely renally eliminated with total Vd ~417 L. Absorption (ka), Tlag, and other values are approximated from these studies for healthy adults. Empty DOI and parameters should be interpreted with caution.</li></ol></body></html>",
