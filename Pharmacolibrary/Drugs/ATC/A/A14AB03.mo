It is a synthetic derivative of nandrolone used for its anabolic properties, such as promoting muscle growth and weight gain. The drug is not approved for current medical use and has primarily historical relevance.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters have not been reported in the scientific literature for oxabolone cipionate in humans.
