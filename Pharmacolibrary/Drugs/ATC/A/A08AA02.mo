    info ="<html><body><p>Fenfluramine is an amphetamine derivative previously used as an appetite suppressant for the treatment of obesity. It acts as a serotonin-releasing agent. Due to its association with pulmonary hypertension and heart valve disease, fenfluramine was withdrawn from the market in most countries in the late 1990s. It has been re-approved in some regions for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy, under the branded name Fintepla.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for healthy adult volunteers after oral administration; typical therapeutic dose.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2125.1989.tb03466.x'>10.1111/j.1365-2125.1989.tb03466.x</a> PK values are extracted from published literature (Hammarlund et al., Br J Clin Pharmacol. 1989 Feb;27(2):227-36).
