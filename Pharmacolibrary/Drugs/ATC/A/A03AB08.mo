It works by inhibiting the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors, thereby reducing smooth muscle spasms in the gastrointestinal tract. Due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives, tridihexethyl is rarely used or approved today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic models or parameterization for tridihexethyl are currently available in the scientific literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
