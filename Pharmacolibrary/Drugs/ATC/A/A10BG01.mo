    info ="<html><body><p>Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione-class antidiabetic agent that was formerly used to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Acting as an agonist at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³), it enhances insulin sensitivity in adipose, muscle, and hepatic tissue. Due to its association with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity and liver failure, troglitazone has been withdrawn from clinical use in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy adult subjects after a single oral dose.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00192355'>10.1007/BF00192355</a> PK data extracted from published mean values in: Ishizaki, T. et al.
