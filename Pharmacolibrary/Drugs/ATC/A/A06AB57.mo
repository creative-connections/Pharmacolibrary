Combination products include cascara with other herbal or pharmacological agents. Cascara has been widely used over the counter, but is less commonly used today and is not approved as a pharmaceutical laxative in many countries due to safety concerns regarding long-term use and a lack of robust clinical evidence.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are not reported in the literature for cascara in combination products or as pure cascara; no relevant clinical pharmacokinetics studies are available for any population. Parameters provided below are rough estimates based on profiles of other anthraquinone-type stimulant laxatives and are for hypothetical healthy adult oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
