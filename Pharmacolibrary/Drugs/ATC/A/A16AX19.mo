    info ="<html><body><p>Fosdenopterin is a synthetic cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate surrogate indicated for the treatment of molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) type A, a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. The drug acts as a substrate replacement, compensating for the biochemical defect in MoCD type A that leads to a life-threatening accumulation of toxic metabolites. Fosdenopterin is approved for use in specific patient populations, notably pediatric and adult patients with this condition.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic estimates are based on summary prescribing information and regulatory approval documents for pediatric and adult patients with MoCD type A. Parameters are not from a published, peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic study.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Schwahn, BC, et al., &amp; Kožich, V (2024).
