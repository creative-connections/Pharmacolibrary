It is used as a dietary supplement for vitamin A deficiency and as a food coloring. Despite its historical use in preventing chronic diseases, supplemental beta-carotene is no longer recommended for general populations due to inconclusive effectiveness and possible harm in smokers.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated parameters for healthy adults; published clinical studies have not consistently reported detailed compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters in humans.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li> There are no reported human population pharmacokinetic models or compartmental PK parameters for beta-carotene in the literature. All parameter values above are estimated from available non-compartmental data, general oral absorption properties, and typical published plasma concentrationâ€“time profiles. Bioavailability is low and highly variable, absorption is slow, and tissue distribution is extensive. These are rough estimates and should not be used for clinical decisions.</li></ol></body></html>",
