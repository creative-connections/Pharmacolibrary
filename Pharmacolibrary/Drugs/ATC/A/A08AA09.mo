Due to concerns about amphetamine-like side effects and potential for abuse, mefenorex has been withdrawn from the market and is not approved for use in most countries today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No dedicated peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic studies in humans could be identified. Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on structurally similar amphetamine derivatives with oral administration in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Rendić, S, et al., &amp; Medić-Sarić, M (1994).
