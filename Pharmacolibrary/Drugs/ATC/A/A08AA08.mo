    info ="<html><body><p>Clobenzorex is a sympathomimetic amine related to amphetamines, formerly used as an anorectic (appetite suppressant) for the treatment of obesity. It has structural similarities to amphetamine and acts as a stimulant. Clobenzorex is not approved for use in many countries and is considered a controlled substance in some jurisdictions due to abuse potential.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed publications with detailed human pharmacokinetic (PK) model parameters for clobenzorex were identified. Below are estimated PK parameters based on structural analogues, literature reviews, and general pharmacological properties of amphetamine derivatives in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Valtier, S, &amp; Cody, JT (2000).
