    info ="<html><body><p>Linseed, also known as flaxseed, is the dried, ripe seed of the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum). It is mainly used as a bulk-forming laxative to treat constipation, due to its high content of soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. Linseed may also have additional uses related to its oil content and omega-3 fatty acids. It is approved for use as a laxative in some countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic model or parameter information is available in the published literature for linseed as a whole or for its fiber component when used orally as a laxative, in any population or age group. Due to its mechanism of action (bulk-forming effects in gastrointestinal tract and minimal systemic absorption), formal PK modeling is generally not performed.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Yang, X, et al., &amp; Reaney, MJT (2021).
