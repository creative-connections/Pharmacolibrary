It is rarely used today, as more effective and safer alternatives are available. The use of aluminium-containing antacids has decreased due to concerns regarding aluminium accumulation and toxicity, particularly in patients with renal impairment.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for aluminium glycinate in humans are not well-established or referenced in available literature. Estimates based on general properties of aluminium-containing antacids in adults, administered orally.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Yokel, RA, &amp; McNamara, PJ (1988).
