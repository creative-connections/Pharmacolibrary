'Silicones' as an ATC drug entry (A03AX13) refers to medicinal forms like simethicone, used to relieve bloating, discomfort, or pain caused by excessive gas in the stomach or intestines. Silicones themselves are not systemically absorbed, metabolized, or used therapeutically beyond their physical actions; simethicone remains in the gastrointestinal tract. The group is approved and in use, notably simethicone as an OTC anti-foaming agent.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No systemic pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are available for silicones (as drugs) since they are pharmacologically inert, not systemically absorbed, and are excreted unchanged in feces. Typical use is in adults and children for gastrointestinal gas symptoms.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Anzillotti, L, et al., &amp; Cecchi, R (2019).
