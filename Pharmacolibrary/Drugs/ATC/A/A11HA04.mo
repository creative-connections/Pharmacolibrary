It plays a key role as a coenzyme in metabolic processes, including energy production, and is important for growth, development, and cellular function. Riboflavin is approved for use as a nutritional supplement and is often included in multivitamin preparations.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported in healthy adult volunteers after single oral dose administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/js960007m'>10.1021/js960007m</a> Pharmacokinetic data extracted from Schuetz, E.G.; Madrzak, J.; Schaefer, W.H., 'Bioavailability of riboflavin in humans.
