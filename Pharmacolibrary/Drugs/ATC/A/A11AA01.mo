It is commonly used in populations at risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as pregnant women, children, and individuals with dietary restrictions. The product is approved and widely available in many countries for preventive and therapeutic use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are not reported for the combination product 'multivitamins and iron' as a whole due to the presence of multiple active ingredients. Estimated single-compartment parameters for oral administration in adults are provided as a rough reference, largely based on typical iron oral pharmacokinetics, since vitamins are generally considered to have variable and ingredient-specific kinetics.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Love, AL, &amp; Billett, HH (2008).
