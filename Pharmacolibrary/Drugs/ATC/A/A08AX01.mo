It was used as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic risk factors. However, due to psychiatric side effects including depression and suicidal ideation, rimonabant was withdrawn from the market and is not currently an approved or available medication.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers, post oral administration of a single 20 mg dose.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Rinaldi-Carmona, M, et al., &amp; Le Fur, G (1996).
