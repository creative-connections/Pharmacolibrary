    info ="<html><body><p>Tiomolibdic acid, also known as bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate, is a chelating agent mainly investigated for the treatment of Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism. It acts by binding copper and preventing its toxic accumulation. It is not approved in all countries for clinical use but has received orphan drug designation and has been approved in the EU under the name Cufence.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published clinical pharmacokinetic studies reporting specific parameters for tiomolibdic acid (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) in humans were identified. The following parameters are estimated based on typical values for chelating agents administered orally.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>E Siegel, S Wason,Boric acid toxicity.,Pediatric clinics of North America,1986<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2870462/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2870462/</a></li><li>Mar√≠lia Afonso Rabelo Buzalaf, Gary Milton Whitford,Fluoride metabolism.,Monographs in oral science,2011<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21701189/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21701189/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
