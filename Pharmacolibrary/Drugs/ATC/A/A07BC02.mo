    info       = "<html><body><table><tr><td>ATC code:</td><td>A07BC02</td></tr><td>route:</td><td>oral</td></tr><tr><td>n-compartments</td><td>1</td></tr></table><p>Kaolin is a naturally occurring clay mineral (hydrated aluminum silicate) historically used as an adsorbent in the treatment of diarrhea and as a gastrointestinal demulcent. It acts by binding toxins and bacteria in the gut. Its medical use for diarrhea has largely been discontinued in modern clinical practice and it is no longer a standard or approved treatment in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No human pharmacokinetic parameters have been reported in the scientific literature for kaolin as it is not systemically absorbed after oral administration; kaolin exerts its action locally in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Jeunesse, EC, et al., &amp; Toutain, PL (2013).
