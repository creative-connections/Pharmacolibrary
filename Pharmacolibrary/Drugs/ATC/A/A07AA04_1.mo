It is typically reserved for use in cases of tuberculosis and other specific infections due to resistance or intolerance to other agents. Streptomycin was historically very important but is now less commonly used due to the availability of newer antibiotics and risk of side effects.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy adult subjects following single intravenous infusion.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/009127009202200414'>10.1177/009127009202200414</a> Parameters from Nicolau, D.
