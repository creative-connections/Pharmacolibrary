    info ="<html><body><p>Methylcellulose is a semi-synthetic, inert, hydrophilic compound derived from cellulose. It is used primarily as a bulk-forming laxative to treat constipation and to promote regular bowel movements. Methylcellulose is currently approved and in widespread clinical use as an over-the-counter oral laxative. It is also used as a food additive and in pharmaceutical formulations as a thickener or emulsifier.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No relevant pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in humans reporting systemic absorption or standard PK parameters (such as volume of distribution, clearance, or bioavailability), since methylcellulose is recognized as not systemically absorbed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract when administered orally as a laxative. All parameters estimated based on its clinical pharmacology and non-absorption.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Manisha Choudhari, Shantanu Damle, Ranendra Narayan Saha, Sunil Kumar Dubey, Gautam Singhvi,Emerging Applications of Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose Acetate Succinate: Different Aspects in Drug Delivery and Its Commercial Potential.,AAPS PharmSciTech,2023<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37715004/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37715004/</a></li><li>Dwayne T Friesen, Ravi Shanker, Marshall Crew, Daniel T Smithey, W J Curatolo, J A S Nightingale,Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate-based spray-dried dispersions: an overview.,Molecular pharmaceutics,2008<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19040386/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19040386/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
