Combination with psycholeptics refers to its use together with sedative drugs that act on the central nervous system. The drug is approved in some countries for gastrointestinal spasm relief but not widely approved in the United States.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic model parameters in healthy adults for oral administration, as no clinical studies with PK data exist for the fixed combination of otilonium bromide and psycholeptics with ATC code A03CA04.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
