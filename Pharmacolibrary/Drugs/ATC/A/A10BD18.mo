    info ="<html><body><p>Metformin and gemigliptin is a fixed-dose combination oral antidiabetic medication used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin is a biguanide that decreases hepatic glucose production and increases insulin sensitivity, while gemigliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that increases incretin hormones, thereby improving glycemic control. This combination is approved and used clinically in several countries for patients who require both agents to achieve adequate glycemic control.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated for healthy adult subjects based on published PK profiles for metformin and gemigliptin administered together; no study was identified reporting full compartmental model parameters for the fixed-dose combination under ATC A10BD18.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Xuanyou Jin, Eunwoo Kim, Ki Young Huh, Inyoung Hwang, Joo-Youn Cho, Kyung-Sang Yu, SeungHwan Lee,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a fixed-dose combination of gemigliptin/metformin sustained release 25/500 mg compared to the loose combination in healthy male subjects.,Translational and clinical pharmacology,2020<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32274380/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32274380/</a></li><li>Dongseong Shin, Young Min Cho, SeungHwan Lee, Kyoung Soo Lim, Jeong-Ae Kim, Ji-Yung Ahn, Joo-Youn Cho, Howard Lee, In-Jin Jang, Kyung-Sang Yu,Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between gemigliptin and metformin in healthy subjects.,Clinical drug investigation,2014<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24627290/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24627290/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
