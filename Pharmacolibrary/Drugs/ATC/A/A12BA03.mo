It is commonly used as a food additive (E336) and occasionally as a potassium supplement to treat or prevent low blood potassium (hypokalemia). It is not widely approved or used as a pharmaceutical agent today, and its medicinal use is rare.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No direct pharmacokinetic (PK) data published for potassium hydrogentartrate as a drug in humans.
