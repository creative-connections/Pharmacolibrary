It is a central nervous system stimulant similar to amphetamine but less potent. Historically, cathine was used as an appetite suppressant and for its mild stimulant properties. Currently, it is a controlled substance in many countries, and it is not an approved pharmaceutical medication for any modern medical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>PK parameters are based on published human studies in healthy adult volunteers (both sexes), following single oral dose administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Stefan W Toennes, Sebastian Harder, Markus Schramm, Constanze Niess, Gerold F Kauert,Pharmacokinetics of cathinone, cathine and norephedrine after the chewing of khat leaves.,British journal of clinical pharmacology,2003<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12848785/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12848785/</a></li><li>Nilesh B Patel,"Natural Amphetamine" Khat: A Cultural Tradition or a Drug of Abuse?,International review of neurobiology,2015<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26070760/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26070760/</a></li></ol></body></html>",
