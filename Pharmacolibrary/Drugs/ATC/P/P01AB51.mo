Both drugs are nitroimidazoles but have different spectra; metronidazole is widely used and approved for various protozoal and anaerobic bacterial infections, while furazolidone has been used for bacterial and protozoal infections but is not widely approved or used today due to toxicity concerns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models specifically for the fixed-dose metronidazole/furazolidone combination were found.
