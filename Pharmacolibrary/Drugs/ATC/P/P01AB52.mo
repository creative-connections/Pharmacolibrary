Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic effective against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, while diloxanide furoate acts as a luminal amebicide. The combination is recommended for both the systemic (tissue) and luminal stages of amoebiasis. The combination is still used in some countries, though not everywhere approved.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific clinical pharmacokinetic parameters for the fixed-dose combination of metronidazole and diloxanide with ATC code P01AB52 were identified in publicly indexed scientific literature. Below PK parameters are estimated from individual drug data in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
