    info ="<html><body><p>Tiabendazole is an antihelmintic drug from the benzimidazole class, mainly used to treat infections caused by roundworms such as strongyloidiasis and trichinosis. It also has antifungal properties and is used as a food preservative. Tiabendazole was widely used but in some countries its use has diminished due to the availability of more effective or safer alternatives. It remains approved in some regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li>O Zaha, T Hirata, F Kinjo, A Saito,Strongyloidiasis--progress in diagnosis and treatment.,Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan),2000<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10969899/'>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10969899/</a></li><li>Graycyelle R S Cavalcanti, Maria G Fonseca, Edson C da Silva Filho, Maguy Jaber,Thiabendazole/bentonites hybrids as controlled release systems.,Colloids and surfaces.
