It is sometimes co-administered with potassium supplements to counteract potassium loss caused by diuretic treatment. Hydroflumethiazide alone is approved and in clinical use in a number of countries, but fixed-dose combinations with potassium are not widely approved as single pharmaceutical products.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies specifically for the fixed-dose combination of hydroflumethiazide and potassium were identified. The following PK parameters are estimated for healthy adults based on data from hydroflumethiazide monotherapy.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
