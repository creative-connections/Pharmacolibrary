The drug and its combinations are not widely approved or used today, and limited information is available regarding current use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic data found for the combination of picodralazine and diuretics with psycholeptics (ATC C02LG73) in any published literature. The following parameters are estimated based on related vasodilators and thiazide diuretic combinations in healthy adult subjects (typical oral administration).</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
