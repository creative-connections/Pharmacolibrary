It is classified under ATC code C02LX01, indicating its use in combination therapy. Pinacidil alone is not widely approved or used today due to the availability of safer antihypertensives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>There are no published studies reporting specific pharmacokinetic parameters for the fixed combination of pinacidil and diuretics in humans. Estimates are provided based on pharmacokinetic data from pinacidil monotherapy in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
