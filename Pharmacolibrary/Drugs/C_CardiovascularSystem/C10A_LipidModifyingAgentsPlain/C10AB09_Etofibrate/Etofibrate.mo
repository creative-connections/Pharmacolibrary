It was used in the past for the treatment of hyperlipidemia to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Etofibrate is no longer widely marketed and has largely been discontinued or replaced by newer therapy in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models or data for etofibrate are available in public literature. The parameters provided here are rough estimates based on the fact that etofibrate is hydrolyzed to clofibric acid and niacin; the parameters are approximated from analogous fibric acid derivatives in typical adult oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Vazquez Lopez, F, et al., &amp; Gutierrez Fuentes, JA (1987).
