They are used as adjuncts to diet for reducing high triglyceride levels in adults and may have cardiovascular benefits. Such formulations are approved for use in managing severe hypertriglyceridemia and for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult subjects based on published literature survey; no direct population PK model data located for omega-3-triglycerides as a drug.
