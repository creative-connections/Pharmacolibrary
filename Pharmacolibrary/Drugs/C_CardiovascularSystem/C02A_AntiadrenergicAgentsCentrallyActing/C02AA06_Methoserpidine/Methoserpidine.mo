It acts as a sympatholytic antihypertensive drug. Methoserpidine is not used in current clinical practice and is considered obsolete and withdrawn in most countries due to side effects and the availability of safer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic studies of methoserpidine have been identified.
