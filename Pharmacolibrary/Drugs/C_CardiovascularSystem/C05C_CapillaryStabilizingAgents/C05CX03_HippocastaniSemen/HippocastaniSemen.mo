Its main active constituent is aescin. It was and is used for the symptomatic treatment of chronic venous insufficiency, hemorrhoids, and related vascular conditions primarily due to its anti-edematous, vascular-protective and anti-inflammatory effects. The drug is available in various oral and topical formulations. Its use is approved in some European countries, but less common or only as a herbal supplement elsewhere.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific pharmacokinetic model or parameter values for total Hippocastani semen or its main constituent aescin in humans were found in the literature.
