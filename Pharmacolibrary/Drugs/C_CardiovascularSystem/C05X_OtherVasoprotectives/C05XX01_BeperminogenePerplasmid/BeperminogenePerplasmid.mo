    </table><p>Beperminogene perplasmid is a gene therapy drug consisting of a plasmid DNA vector encoding human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). It is administered as a regenerative treatment for critical limb ischemia due to peripheral arterial disease to promote angiogenesis. It has been approved for use in Japan but is not widely approved globally.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic study or PK model exists for beperminogene perplasmid, as it is a gene therapy and not a standard small molecule or protein pharmacokinetic entity. Typical PK parameters do not apply to non-viral plasmid gene therapies. Doses are usually measured by Î¼g of plasmid DNA injected intramuscularly; systemic PK such as absorption, clearance, Vd are not characterized.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
