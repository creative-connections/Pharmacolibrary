It was developed primarily for use as a pharmacologic agent in cardiac stress testing (myocardial perfusion imaging) in patients unable to exercise adequately. Arbutamine is not widely used today and has been discontinued in many markets; it is not approved for current clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data could be found for arbutamine in humans. Neither population nor single-dose PK studies in adults are referenced in the literature. The parameters below are estimated based on its class and general properties of similar beta-agonists (e.g., dobutamine).</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Riviere, JE, et al., &amp; Mishky, LM (1992).
