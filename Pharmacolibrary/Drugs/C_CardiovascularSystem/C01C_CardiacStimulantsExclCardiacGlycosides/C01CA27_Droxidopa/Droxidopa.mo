It is used as a prodrug to increase norepinephrine concentrations, primarily for the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, and non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy. It is currently approved for use in several countries, including the United States.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for oral droxidopa use in adults with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension; general adult population with normal hepatic and renal function.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
