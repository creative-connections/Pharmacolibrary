It targets vascular endothelium, improves capillary resistance, and is available as oral and topical formulations. Tribenoside is not widely approved in all regulatory jurisdictions but remains in use in several European and Latin American countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic model with parameterization for tribenoside in humans could be identified in accessible literature as of June 2024, thus approximate values are estimated based on class properties and indirect references.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Sioufi, A, &amp; Pommier, F (1982).
