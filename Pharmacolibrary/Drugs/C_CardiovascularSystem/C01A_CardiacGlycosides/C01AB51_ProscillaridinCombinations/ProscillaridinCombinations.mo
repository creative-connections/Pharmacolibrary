It was historically used to treat certain forms of heart failure and arrhythmias by increasing myocardial contractility. However, its use today is rare or discontinued in many regions due to the narrow therapeutic index and safer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adults; no published human pharmacokinetic studies on proscillaridin combinations are available to date.
