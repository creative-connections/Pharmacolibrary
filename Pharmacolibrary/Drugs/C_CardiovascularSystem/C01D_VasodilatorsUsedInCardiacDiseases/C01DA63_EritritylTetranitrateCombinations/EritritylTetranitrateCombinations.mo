    info ="<html><body><p>Eritrityl tetranitrate is an organic nitrate compound previously used as a vasodilator for the prevention and treatment of angina pectoris. It acts by releasing nitric oxide, which relaxes smooth muscles and dilates blood vessels. Its combinations were used primarily in cardiovascular therapeutics but are largely obsolete and rarely prescribed today, having been replaced by more modern agents.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific pharmacokinetic models or parameter data for eritrityl tetranitrate in combinations (ATC C01DA63) are available in published sources for any patient group.
