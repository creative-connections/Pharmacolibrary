It acts as an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist, leading to vasoconstriction of conjunctival blood vessels. It is approved and widely available as an ingredient in eye drops for temporary relief of redness.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No human pharmacokinetic parameters have been reported for tetryzoline in peer-reviewed literature for ocular or oral exposure. Pharmacokinetic parameters below are estimated based on limited data from animal studies and typical topical ophthalmic formulation usage.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Okur, NÜ, et al., &amp; Okur, ME (2020).
