Fludrocortisone is a synthetic corticosteroid with primarily mineralocorticoid properties, and in such combinations, it is usually given locally with one or more antiinfective agents (antibiotic or antifungal) for the management of otitis externa or similar infections. These combinations are approved and marketed in certain countries for local use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters are available for the combination of fludrocortisone with antiinfectives administered by the otic (ear) route in humans. Systemic absorption is expected to be minimal when used in recommended otic doses; any PK parameters provided below are theoretical estimates based on the general properties of topical corticosteroids and known fludrocortisone systemic pharmacokinetics when given orally or intravenously.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
