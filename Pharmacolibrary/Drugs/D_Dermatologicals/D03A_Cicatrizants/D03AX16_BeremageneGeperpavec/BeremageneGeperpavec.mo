It is indicated for the treatment of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), a rare genetic skin disorder characterized by defects in type VII collagen. Beremagene geperpavec restores COL7A1 gene expression and facilitates production of functional type VII collagen at the dermal-epidermal junction. The drug received FDA approval in 2023 for use in patients with DEB.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data are available for beremagene geperpavec in humans. Due to its design as a non-replicating topical gene therapy, systemic absorption is expected to be minimal or absent. No specific data available for individuals by sex, age, or condition.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
