It has been used historically as a topical antiseptic and preservative, predominantly in dermatology for skin and wound disinfection. Today, its clinical use is rare, and it is more commonly found in laboratory and cosmetic applications.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No human in vivo pharmacokinetic study is available for cetrimonium (CTAB) in the published literature. Therefore, the following represents an estimated one-compartment model for topical administration in adults, based on physicochemical properties, class similarity and limited non-clinical data.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Zainuddin, N, et al., &amp; Ramli, S (2021).
