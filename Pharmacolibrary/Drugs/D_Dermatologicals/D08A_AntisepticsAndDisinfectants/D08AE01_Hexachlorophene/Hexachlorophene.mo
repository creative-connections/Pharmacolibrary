It was widely utilized in the 20th century for hand washing in hospitals and as a preservative in soaps and cosmetics. Due to risks of neurotoxicity, especially in neonates, its use is now highly restricted or banned in most countries, with very limited approved medical uses.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific pharmacokinetic data are available in the published literature for humans; estimates are provided based on limited data from animal studies and case reports.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Mancini, AJ (2004).
