It is not widely used systemically because it is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has been largely replaced by other tetracyclines. It is no longer commonly prescribed and not widely approved for use today in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters based on class similarity (tetracyclines) due to lack of direct studies in humans for systemic administration.
