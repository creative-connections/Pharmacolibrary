It acts as a keratolytic agent with bactericidal properties, reducing the bacterial count associated with acne and promoting the turnover of skin cells. These combinations may include antibiotics or retinoids to enhance acne therapy. Benzoyl peroxide is widely approved and used in current clinical practice for the management of acne.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adults based on topical administration in the absence of reported compartmental models. Literature specifically reporting compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for combinations of benzoyl peroxide (D10AE51) is not available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Ino, H, et al., &amp; Hasegawa, S (2015).
