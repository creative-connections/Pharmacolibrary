It was one of the first antibiotics discovered and was widely used before the advent of penicillins and other modern drugs. Today, it is rarely used in systemic therapy due to the availability of safer and more effective antibiotics. It may still be found in some topical preparations for skin infections.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for orally administered sulfanilamide in healthy adults, based on historical reports and typical sulfonamide PK properties.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Dong, L, et al., &amp; He, J (2023).
