The drug acts by releasing silver ions that are bactericidal and by inhibiting bacterial growth. It is generally applied as a cream and is approved and widely used in clinical burn care.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic estimates based on available data in adults with burn wounds; limited systemic absorption occurs through damaged skin, with kinetics mostly described for sulfadiazine component as silver is poorly absorbed.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Fuller, FW (2009).
