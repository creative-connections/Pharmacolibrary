    info ="<html><body><p>Mepartricin is a polyene macrolide antifungal agent formerly used for the treatment of various fungal infections, including vaginal candidiasis and prostatic conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. It acts locally and is poorly absorbed systemically when administered orally. It is not in widespread clinical use or approved in many countries today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published primary pharmacokinetic studies specific to mepartricin in humans could be identified; estimated parameters are based on general properties of polyene antifungals and available pharmacological summaries.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Del Vecchio, S, et al., &amp; Ricci, GL (1990).
