    </table><p>Undecylenic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid derived from castor oil, primarily used as a topical antifungal agent for skin infections such as tinea pedis (athleteâ€™s foot) and tinea corporis (ringworm). It is not a systemically approved drug and is mainly administered in cream, powder, or solution form for dermatological use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No human pharmacokinetic studies are available for undecylenic acid. Systemic exposure is presumed negligible when applied topically to intact skin in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
