It was originally developed as an antihypertensive agent but is now mainly approved for topical application to stimulate hair growth. Minoxidil is approved and widely used today for hair loss, both over-the-counter and by prescription, in topical formulations; oral use for hypertension is rare due to adverse effect profile.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers, primarily following oral administration of minoxidil.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Dong, W, et al., &amp; Sung, CT (2024).
