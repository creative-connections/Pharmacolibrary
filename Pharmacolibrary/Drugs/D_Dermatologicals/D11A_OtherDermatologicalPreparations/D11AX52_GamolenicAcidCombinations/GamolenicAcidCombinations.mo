Combinations of gamolenic acid are used mainly for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and certain skin disorders due to their anti-inflammatory properties, though robust evidence for efficacy is limited and usage has declined. It is not considered a first-line therapy and is not widely approved in national or international guidelines for routine use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetics in healthy adult individuals, both sexes, ages 18-65. No primary PK studies exist for combinations with D11AX52; values are based on general GLA pharmacokinetics from related oral preparations.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Demmelmair, H, et al., &amp; Kratl, G (2001).
