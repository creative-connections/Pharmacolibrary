It is a prescription medication and approved for dermatological use in several countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No human pharmacokinetic (PK) studies specifically for hydrocortisone buteprate have been published. Its PK parameters are not available in clinical literature; estimates could be made based on systemic corticosteroid absorption through skin, but topical steroids are intended for minimal systemic absorption.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Yanagawa, A, Mizushima, Y, Komatsu, A, Horiuchi, M, Shirasawa, E, &amp; Igarashi, R (1987).
