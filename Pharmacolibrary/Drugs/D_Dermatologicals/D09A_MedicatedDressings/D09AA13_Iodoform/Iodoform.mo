It was historically used in topical dressings and some dental applications, but is largely obsolete in modern medicine due to the development of more effective and less toxic antiseptics.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No relevant pharmacokinetic studies in humans found. Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on physicochemical properties and analogous halogenated hydrocarbons.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Tada, M, et al., &amp; Hirota, K (2002).
