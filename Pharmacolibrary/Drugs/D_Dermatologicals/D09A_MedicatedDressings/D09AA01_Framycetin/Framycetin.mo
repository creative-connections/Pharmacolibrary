Its main clinical usefulness is in topical preparations—creams, ointments, and ear/eye drops—for the treatment of skin, ear, and eye infections. It is not typically used systemically due to significant nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity risks, and is not widely approved for oral or intravenous systemic use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for topical framycetin based on aminoglycoside class characteristics as no direct human PK study with systemic dosing of framycetin was identified. Estimates are extrapolated from studies of neomycin B administered parenterally in animals.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Wu, Z, et al., &amp; Chen, X (2025).
