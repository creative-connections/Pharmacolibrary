    info ="<html><body><p>Artesunate, sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine is a fixed-dose combination antimalarial drug regimen used for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Artesunate is a fast-acting artemisinin derivative, while sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine inhibit folate synthesis in the parasite. Combination therapy helps delay resistance and improve efficacy. Artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is approved and used in some malaria-endemic countries including India and parts of Africa.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for adults, healthy volunteers and malaria patients, as reported in the literature, per component drug (reporting median or typical values where available).</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
