While the racemic mixture praziquantel has been widely used for decades and is approved, arpraziquantel itself has been developed to potentially offer improved efficacy and reduced adverse effects, but it is not yet widely approved or commercially available.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for arpraziquantel in adult humans, based on data available for racemic praziquantel and the (R)-enantiomer, since no human clinical PK studies of arpraziquantel were found in the literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>N&#x27;Goran, EK, et al., &amp; Haj-Ali Saflo, O (2023).
