It acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to paralyze helminths. Bephenium is not currently approved or widely used due to the development of more effective and less toxic alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies with explicit PK parameters for bephenium in humans are available.
