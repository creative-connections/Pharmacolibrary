It also has antifungal properties and is used as a food preservative. Tiabendazole was widely used but in some countries its use has diminished due to the availability of more effective or safer alternatives. It remains approved in some regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Boken, DJ, et al., &amp; Preheim, LC (1993).
