It has also been investigated and clinically used as a hypoxic radiosensitizer in the adjunct treatment of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, particularly squamous cell carcinomas. Nimorazole is not widely approved or marketed today as an antiparasitic due to the availability of alternative drugs but sees some use in oncology in selected regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers (both sexes), following a single oral dose of nimorazole.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Hassan Metwally, MA, et al., &amp; Overgaard, J (2015).
