It is sometimes used in combination with other potassium salts and is typically administered intravenously in hospital settings. It is approved and commonly used in clinical practice for patients with phosphate depletion, particularly in critical care, parenteral nutrition, and certain renal conditions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated based on typical physiological phosphate handling in adult patients receiving intravenous potassium phosphate.
