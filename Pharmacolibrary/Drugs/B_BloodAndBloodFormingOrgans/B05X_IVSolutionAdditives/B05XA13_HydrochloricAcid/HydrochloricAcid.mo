As a drug, its main use is as a component in intravenous nutritional solutions to adjust pH or to treat severe metabolic alkalosis. It is not commonly used as a stand-alone therapeutic agent and is not an approved drug for most pharmacological indications in modern practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic studies in human subjects describing absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion have been published because hydrochloric acid is a naturally present and rapidly neutralized/ionized substance in body fluids. Parameters below are not reported in primary literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Brooks, EC, et al., &amp; Terada, LS (1997).
