These combinations are approved and routinely used for intravenous infusion, particularly in hospitals.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies are directly available for 'electrolytes in combination with other drugs' as a group under ATC code B05XA31 in standard scientific literature. The pharmacokinetic characteristics are estimated based on the behavior of electrolytes following intravenous administration in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>el-Mougi, M, et al., &amp; Pierce, NF (1996).
