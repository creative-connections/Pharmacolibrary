It has also been used to promote urinary acidification and as a diuretic. Its clinical use is limited today, though it is sometimes applied in laboratory or veterinary settings rather than routinely in human medicine.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for a typical healthy adult after oral administration, as no direct published human PK studies were found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Liu, R, et al., &amp; Lee, EJ (2011).
