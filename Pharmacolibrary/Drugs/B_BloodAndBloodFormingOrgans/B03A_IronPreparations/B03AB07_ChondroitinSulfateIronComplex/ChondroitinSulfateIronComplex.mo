    info ="<html><body><p>Chondroitin sulfate-iron complex is a pharmaceutical compound where chondroitin sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan commonly used in osteoarthritis, is complexed with iron to provide iron supplementation. It has been considered for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, utilizing the chondroitin sulfate as a carrier to potentially increase gastrointestinal tolerability. This combination is not commonly approved or widely used today as an iron supplement, with very limited clinical and pharmacokinetic data published.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies directly reporting chondroitin sulfate-iron complex PK parameters in humans were found. The following parameters are roughly estimated based on known oral iron salt pharmacokinetics and the absorption characteristics of similar complexes.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
