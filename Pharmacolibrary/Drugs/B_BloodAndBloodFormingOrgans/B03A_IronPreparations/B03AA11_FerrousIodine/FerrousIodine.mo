It is not currently in common or approved use in modern therapeutics due to the availability of better-characterized and safer iron and iodine supplements.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models or human studies specifically report pharmacokinetic parameters for ferrous iodine as a separate compound in healthy volunteers or patients. As such, parameters are estimated based on pharmacokinetics of other commonly used ferrous salts in oral iron therapy.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Sattarzadeh, M, &amp; Zlotkin, SH (1999). Iron is well absorbed by healthy adults after ingestion of double-fortified (iron and dextran-coated iodine) table salt and urinary iodine excretion is unaffected. <i>The Journal of nutrition</i> 129(1) 117â€“121.
