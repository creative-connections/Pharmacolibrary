    info ="<html><body><p>Doxazosin and finasteride is a combination drug used primarily in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. Doxazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker that relaxes smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, while finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that lowers levels of dihydrotestosterone, resulting in shrinkage of the enlarged prostate. The fixed-dose combination is marketed in some regions but may not be universally approved or widely used.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published population pharmacokinetic models for the fixed-dose combination of doxazosin and finasteride were identified. The following are estimates based on known pharmacokinetics of individual drugs in healthy adult males, assuming standard oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Pupe, CG, et al., &amp; Cabral, LM (2013).
