    </table><p>Dequalinium is a quaternary ammonium compound used primarily as an antiseptic and disinfectant. It is commonly found in lozenges or topical formulations for oral, vaginal, and skin infections due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria and Candida species. Dequalinium is approved in some countries for topical use, such as treatment of vaginal infections.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies in humans identified; parameters are estimated based on physicochemical properties and clinical use. Estimates refer to typical adult healthy female vaginal use.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
