It acts primarily by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. Omoconazole is approved and in use in certain countries, though it is less widely available globally compared to other azole antifungals.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for omoconazole in humans were found in existing literature.
