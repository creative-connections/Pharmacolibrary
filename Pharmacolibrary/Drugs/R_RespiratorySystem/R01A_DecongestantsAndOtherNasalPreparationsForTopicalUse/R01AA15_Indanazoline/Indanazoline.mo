    info ="<html><body><p>Indanazoline is an imidazoline derivative that acts as a topical nasal decongestant by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors. It causes vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion. Indanazoline is used primarily for symptomatic relief of nasal congestion in conditions such as rhinitis. It is not widely used or approved in many countries today, with limited information on its regulatory status.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data or clinical PK model available for indanazoline in humans. Values below are estimated based on class similarity (topical nasal imidazolines such as xylometazoline and oxymetazoline), assuming typical adult use.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
