Its use is now limited because of side effects and availability of safer alternatives. It is approved in some countries for specific indications, but its misuse as a stimulant and for weight loss has led to restrictions in many jurisdictions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy adults after single oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Howard, DR, et al., &amp; Agrawala, P (2005).
