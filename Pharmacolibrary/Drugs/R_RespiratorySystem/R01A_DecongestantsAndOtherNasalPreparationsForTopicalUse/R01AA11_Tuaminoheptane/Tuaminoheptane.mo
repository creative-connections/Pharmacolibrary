    info ="<html><body><p>Tuaminoheptane is a sympathomimetic amine that acts as a nasal decongestant. It was formerly used in nasal sprays for the relief of nasal congestion associated with colds, allergies, and sinusitis. It has a similar mechanism of action as other alpha-adrenergic agonists. Tuaminoheptane is currently not widely used and is not approved in many countries due to potential for abuse and adverse cardiovascular effects.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters for tuaminoheptane have been reported in peer-reviewed scientific literature in humans or animals. Thus, PK parameters are not available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
