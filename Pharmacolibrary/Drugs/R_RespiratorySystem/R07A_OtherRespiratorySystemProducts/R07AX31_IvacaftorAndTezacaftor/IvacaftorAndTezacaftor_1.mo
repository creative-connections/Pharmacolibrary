    info ="<html><body><p>Ivacaftor and tezacaftor are combined as a fixed-dose oral therapy indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients with specific CFTR gene mutations. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator, increasing chloride transport, while tezacaftor is a CFTR corrector that improves processing and trafficking of the protein to the cell surface. The combination is approved for use in several countries, including the US and EU.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Population pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy adult volunteers; oral administration as fixed combination.
