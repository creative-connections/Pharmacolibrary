    info ="<html><body><p>This combination drug is used as a bronchodilator for the treatment of obstructive airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Epinephrine acts as a non-selective adrenergic agonist, causing bronchodilation and relief of bronchospasm. The combination is intended for acute management of bronchoconstrictive episodes. There are limited available modern fixed-dose combinations with this specific ATC, and such combinations are not widely used or approved in current clinical guidelines.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on general epinephrine inhalation data in healthy adults; no published population-specific PK studies were found for R03AK01 fixed-dose combinations.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
