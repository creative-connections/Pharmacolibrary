Combination products in the ATC R03AK02 category are generally used for inhalation therapy to relieve bronchoconstriction. Isoprenaline's use in asthma management has diminished significantly due to cardiovascular side effects and availability of safer alternatives; it is rarely used or approved for modern obstructive airways disease treatment.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated parameters for inhaled isoprenaline in adults; no direct PK/PD clinical studies or compartmental pharmacokinetic models are reported for R03AK02 in the current literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
