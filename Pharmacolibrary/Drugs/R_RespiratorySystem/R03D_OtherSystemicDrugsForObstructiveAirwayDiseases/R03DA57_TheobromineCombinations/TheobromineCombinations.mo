It is structurally similar to caffeine and acts as a mild stimulant and bronchodilator. Combinations of theobromine are historically used in respiratory therapy, particularly as antiasthmatic agents. Its use in modern therapy is limited, and it is not widely approved for current clinical applications.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific pharmacokinetic data for theobromine combinations with ATC code R03DA57 reported in published sources. Estimated parameters are extrapolated based on theobromine monotherapy studies in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Zandvliet, AS, et al., &amp; Beijnen, JH (2005).
