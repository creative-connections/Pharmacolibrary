It is primarily employed to prevent low blood pressure during anesthesia, for the treatment of nasal congestion, and historically as a bronchodilator for asthma. Due to potential side effects and abuse, its use for asthma and as an over-the-counter stimulant has become less common; however, it remains approved and is still used in clinical settings worldwide for specific indications.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from healthy adult subjects after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Howard, DR, et al., &amp; Agrawala, P (2005).
