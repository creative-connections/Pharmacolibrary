It is no longer authorized or marketed in many regions (including the EU) due to concerns about serious allergic reactions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic studies on fusafungine could be identified in indexed biomedical literature. Product information indicates topical administration as a spray, with assumed minimal systemic absorption. PK parameters are estimated based on its administration route and local action.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Newman, SP, et al., &amp; Brickwell, J (1995).
