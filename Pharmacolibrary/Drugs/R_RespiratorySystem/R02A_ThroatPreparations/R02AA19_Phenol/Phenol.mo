Its use as a medicinal agent is now limited due to toxicity concerns. Phenol is not widely approved for systemic administration today and its use in clinical medicine is mostly restricted to topical application or as a component in throat lozenges and sprays.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No modern publication with detailed human pharmacokinetic modeling or clinical PK parameters of phenol is available for ATC R02AA19 (throat preparations, human use). Data is scarce; parameterization below is an estimate based on historical and toxicological reports for healthy adults with topical/mucosal exposure.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Sun, HF, et al., &amp; Li, D (2018).
