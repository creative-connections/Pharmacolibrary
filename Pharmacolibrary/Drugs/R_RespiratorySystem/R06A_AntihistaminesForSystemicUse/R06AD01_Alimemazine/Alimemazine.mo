It has been used for symptomatic relief of allergy, pruritus, and as a sedative, especially in pediatric settings; however, its use has declined and in several countries it is not commonly approved or prescribed today due to side effects and availability of safer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult subjects based on secondary sources, as no primary PK studies with full compartmental model details are available in scientific literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Dumortier, G, et al., &amp; Degrassat, K (2005).
