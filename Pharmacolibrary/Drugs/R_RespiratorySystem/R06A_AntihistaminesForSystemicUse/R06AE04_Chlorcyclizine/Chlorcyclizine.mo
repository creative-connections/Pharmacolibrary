It is also used for its antiemetic effects in motion sickness. Due to its sedative and anticholinergic side effects compared to newer agents, its use has declined in favor of newer antihistamines.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for a standard healthy adult population as no human-specific published pharmacokinetic studies are available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Brinkley, LL, &amp; Morris-Wiman, J (1987).
