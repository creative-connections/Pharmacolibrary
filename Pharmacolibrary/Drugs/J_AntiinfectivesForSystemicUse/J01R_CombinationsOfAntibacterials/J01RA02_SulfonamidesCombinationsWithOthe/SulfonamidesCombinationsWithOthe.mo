Sulfonamides inhibit bacterial folic acid synthesis, thus exerting a bacteriostatic effect, and combinations are often used to broaden the antibacterial spectrum or reduce resistance. These fixed combinations were used in the treatment of various bacterial infections, but their usage has drastically diminished due to the risk of adverse effects and widespread antibiotic resistance. They are rarely approved or in use in contemporary clinical practice in many regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for typical adult patients (age 18â€“65) with normal renal and hepatic function after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
