It is generally considered when conventional treatment is not effective or cannot be tolerated. Terizidone is not widely used today, with limited approval and its use often being restricted to specialized protocols.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic (PK) studies directly report human PK parameters for terizidone. Estimates below are based on known properties of cycloserine, a structurally related compound, and general pharmacokinetic principles. The values are rough estimates and should not be used for clinical purposes.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Court, R, et al., &amp; McIlleron, H (2018).
