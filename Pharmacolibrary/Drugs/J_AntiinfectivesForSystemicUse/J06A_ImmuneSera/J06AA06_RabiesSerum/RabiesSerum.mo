It provides immediate but temporary protection and is administered as part of post-exposure prophylaxis along with rabies vaccine. Currently, rabies serum is approved and used for post-exposure prophylaxis in humans exposed to potentially rabid animals.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published clinical pharmacokinetic models with detailed quantitative parameters for human rabies immunoglobulin (rabies serum) in adults, children, or special populations were identified in the public scientific literature as of June 2024. Relevant values are estimated based on general pharmacokinetic properties of human immunoglobulins.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Arya, JM, et al., &amp; Prausnitz, MR (2016).
