It was used as a post-exposure prophylactic therapy for TBE infection, particularly in endemic regions. Due to risk of antibody-dependent enhancement and lack of evidence for efficacy, its use has been discontinued and is not currently approved in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies specific to tick borne encephalitis immunoglobulin (ATC J06BB12) could be located. As such, PK parameters are estimated based on data from similar human immunoglobulin G intravenous (IVIg) products administered to healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Adner, N, et al., &amp; Wahlberg, T (2001).
