It consists of outer membrane vesicles prepared from the bacterium and is used for immunization, especially in outbreak settings or in populations at increased risk of meningococcal B disease. The vaccine is approved and in use in various countries for prevention of meningococcal group B infections.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters have been reported in the published literature for the OMV-based meningococcus B vaccine. As a vaccine, PK modeling is typically not applicable since the active component is not a small molecule drug but a complex biological product meant to induce an immune response rather than achieve a target systemic concentration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
